The interference at lower photon energies provided the refined film thicknesses ranging between 70 and 200 nm. The films were grown under compressive strain and displayed saturation magnetizations (mu(0)M(s)) lower than that of their bulk counterparts due to the presence of nanograins forming BiYIG layers and/or magnetically dead interface layers. The trends in the MO spectra agree with those deduced from the published permittivity tensor data for BiYIG using a transfer matrix model applied to a film (BiYIG)-substrate (GGG) system. Due to the reduced mu(0)M(s) the predicted amplitudes are typically higher. The agreement was improved using effective medium approach or by incorporating into the model MO passive interface layers. The information on MO activity at longitudinal magnetization in the garnet layers below 100 nm presents interest for MO imaging and magnetophotonic devices. The results suggest that the MO Kerr spectroscopy combined with MO Kerr magnetometry may represent a valuable, cheap and nondestructive tool for the characterization of magnetic garnet films less than 200 nm thick.
