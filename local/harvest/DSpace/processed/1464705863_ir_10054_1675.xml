product) over India available during the period 2002-2005 were
analysed along with limited ground truth data in terms of soil
moisture and rainfall. It has been observed that AMSR-E derived
soil moisture in arid region (desert area) over estimates by 4%.
About 2% underestimation of soil moisture was obtained at
another test site with agriculture practices. By comparing
estimated soil moisture and rainfall data, we found that estimated
soil moisture varies well with rainfall for uniform bare fields. The
heavy rainfall events in several parts of India that lead to
flooding were clearly seen through soil moisture maps of 4 years.
Drought situation in 2002 was also observed through soil
moisture maps. The soil moisture retrieval accuracy depends on
inhomogeneity in a resolution cell.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-09-26T07:19:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T09:04:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:58:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-09-26T07:19:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T09:04:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:58:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, Denver, USA, 31 July - 4 August 2006, 2999 - 3002</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-9510-7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1109/IGARSS.2006.770</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1675</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1675</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
