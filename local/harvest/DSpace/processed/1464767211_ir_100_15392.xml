Design and Study sample: Listening tests involving consonant recognition and source direction identification were conducted on six normal-hearing subjects under simulated hearing loss and on eleven subjects with moderate bilateral sensorineural loss in quiet. Results: The tests on normal-hearing subjects showed higher recognition scores and smaller response times for the comb filters based on the auditory critical bandwidth. The tests using these comb filters on the hearing-impaired subjects resulted in an increase of 14%-31% (mean: 22%) in recognition scores and a significant decrease in response times, with no significant effect on the identification of the direction of broadband sound sources. Conclusions: The results show that dichotic presentation may be useful for speech processing in binaural hearing aids.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INFORMA HEALTHCARE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T05:56:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T05:56:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY, 51(4)334-344</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/14992027.2011.642012</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15392</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
