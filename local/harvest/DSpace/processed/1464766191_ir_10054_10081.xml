In the process, the sizing material from the carbon fibre tow was removed by acetone treatment and the fibre surfaces were activated with 0.5 wt % PdCl2 acidic solution. Plating was then carried out under optimized conditions using standard Watt's bath. Optical and Scanning electron microscopy have shown that the coating is of uniform thickness and coherent. The fibres were coated with a coating thickness ranging from 0.08 mu m to 0.83 mu m. Weibull analysis of tensile strengths of the single fibres in as received, sizing-removed and nickel-coated conditions was carried out.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MESHAP SCIENCE PUBLISHERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-18T17:22:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-18T17:22:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>METALS MATERIALS AND PROCESSES, 8(2), 187-191</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0970-423X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10081</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10081</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
