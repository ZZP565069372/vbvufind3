The resonances of Cu-63(II) and Cu-65(II) have been observed at 31.50 and 29.15 MHz, respectively. These frequencies are the same as those in YBa2Cu3O7 but not in accordance with the expectations from the decrease of resonance frequency in RBa2Cu3O7 compounds. Nu(Q)63/nu(Q)65 is 1.08 which is the ratio of the eQ(Cu-63)/eQ(Cu-65), implying that there is no static magnetic field at the Cu(II) site. The relaxation times T1 and T2 at 31.50 MHz have been determined and are found to be 42 ms and 140 mus, respectively. T1 is much less than that (approximately 1 s) in YBa2Cu3O7 and EuBa2Cu3O7, indicating that fluctuating moments are present in the material. These could be either on Cu ions that are close to Pr ions or on Pr ions themselves. The contrasting behavior of resonance frequency and T1 in Lu0.9Pr0.1Ba2Cu3O7 with respect to other 1:2:3 compounds is commented upon.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-10T16:10:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:08:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-10T16:10:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:08:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>1993</dc:date><dc:type>Note</dc:type><dc:identifier>PHYSICAL REVIEW B,47(2)1123-1125</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0163-1829</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.47.1123</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/13120</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/707</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
