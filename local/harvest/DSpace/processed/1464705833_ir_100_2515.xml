However, the ECG signal acquired by the ambulatory recorder is influenced by motion artifacts induced by any body movement activity (BMA). The goal of the paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to determine the BMA from the motion artifacts in the ECG signal itself. The ECG signal during a specific BMA is presumed to be an additive mix or signals due to cardiac activities, motion artifacts induced due to the BMA and sensor noise. We propose to characterize and determine the BMA from the corresponding motion artifact data in the ECG signal itself. The proposed technique is useful for removal of motion artifacts from the ECG signals for ambulatoryN cardiac nionitorin'o.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T09:04:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T09:04:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>2006 28th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, Vols 1-15,746-749</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-1-4244-0032-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15963</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2515</dc:identifier><dc:source>28th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society,New York, NY,AUG 30-SEP 03, 2006</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
