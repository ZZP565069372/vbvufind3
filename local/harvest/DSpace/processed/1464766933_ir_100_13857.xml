Flow instabilities begin with ribbing and eventually lead to generation of air-borne droplets called mist. As speed was raised, a uniform film thickness evolved into one with ribs, which evolved into continuous sheets of liquid extending downstream of the gap between the cylinders. The edge of each sheet formed a rim whose two ends were attached to the ribs on the cylinders. Still images via high-speed photography revealed a new mechanism for mist generation: the sheets extended downstream, became unstable and ruptured to produce air-borne droplets. A droplet time-of-flight measurement technique quantified the effect of process settings (speed and speed ratio) and material properties (viscosity and surface tension) on droplet size, count, and mass concentration of mist.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-02-08T18:52:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-02-08T18:52:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDUSTRIAL &amp; ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH,50(6)3212-3219</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0888-5885</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie100747w</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/13857</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
