The meteorological drought conditions are analyzed using 6-month standardized precipitation index (SPI-6) estimated at spatial resolution of 0.5A degrees A xA 0.5A degrees. Spatio-temporal analysis of SPI-6 indicates increase in frequency of droughts at the central part of the region. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test for seasonal trend analysis showed increase in number of grids under drought during the study period. Further, bivariate frequency analysis of drought characteristics-intensity and areal extent is carried out using copula methods. For modeling joint dependence between drought variables, three copula families namely Gumbel-Hougaard, Frank and Plackett copulas are evaluated. Based on goodness-of-fit as well as upper tail dependence tests, it is found that the Gumbel-Hougaard copula best represents the drought properties. The copula-based joint distribution is used to compute conditional return periods and drought intensity-area-frequency (I-A-F) curves. The I-A-F curves could be helpful in risk evaluation of droughts in the region.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T11:06:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T11:06:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT, 27(8)1975-1989</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-013-0732-z</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14820</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
