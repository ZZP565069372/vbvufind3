High penetration of power at distribution level creates such multiple microgrids. This paper proposes a two-level architecture for distributed-energy-resource management for multiple microgrids using multiagent systems. In order to match the buyers and sellers in the energy market, symmetrical assignment problem based on naive auction algorithm is used. The developed mechanism allows the pool members such as generation agents, load agents, auction agents, grid agents, and storage agents to participate in market. Three different scenarios are identified based on the supply-demand mismatch among the participating microgrids. At the end of this paper, two case studies are presented with two and four interconnected microgrids participating in the market. Simulation results clearly indicate that the agent-based management is effective in resource management among multiple microgrids economically and profitably.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T14:02:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T14:02:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, 60(4)1678-1687</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2193857</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15053</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
