This method can be used for getting the displacement of various instances of time. The effect of the enclosed air has also been taken into consideration. The displacement and damping characteristics for uniform single, double and triple membranes which are centrally loaded have been plotted. It was found that the damping is much slower and better harmonics are developed when these membranes are used for drums as in case of Indian drums than drums with single membrane.</dc:description><dc:publisher>COUNCIL SCIENTIFIC INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-20T20:21:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-20T20:21:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>1994</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDIAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND MATERIALS SCIENCES, 1(3), 121-126</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0971-4588</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5636</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5636</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
