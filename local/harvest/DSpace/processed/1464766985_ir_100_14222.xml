The compounds exhibit mostly quinone-ligand-based redox activity within a narrow potential range, high-intensity near-IR absorptions (lambda(max) approximate to 920 nm; epsilon &gt; 50 000 M(-1) cm(-1)), and variable intra- and intermolecular spin-spin interactions. Density functional theory calculations, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and spectro-electrochemical results (UV-vis-near-IR region) for three one-electron-reduction and two one-electron-oxidation processes were used to probe the electronic structures of the systems in the various accessible valence states. EPR spectroscopy of the singly charged doublet species showed semiquinone-type response for 1(+), 2(+), and 2(-), while 1 exhibits more metal based spin, a consequence of the easier reduction of Q as compared to DTBQ, Comparison with the analogous redox series involving a more basic N-phenyhminoquinone ligand reveals significant differences related to the shifted redox potentials, different space requirements, and different interactions between the metals and the quinone-type ligands. As a result, the tppz bridge is reduced here only after full reduction of the terminal quinone ligands to their catecholate states.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-06-26T08:48:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-06-26T08:48:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INORGANIC CHEMISTRY,50(11)4753-4763</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0020-1669</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic102280q</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14222</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
