This flattening is similar to the characteristics in constant-properties slip flow, and high rate of flattening can cause hydrodynamic undevelopment of flow-the reverse process of hydrodynamic development. By continuity, radially outward velocities and radial convection are induced, which degrades convection performance. The low densities near the wall reduce the axial mass flux near the wall, which also degrades convection performance. In heated-gas micro-flows, these negative effects dominate to dictate the net convection characteristics, which differ considerably from the known characteristics of conventional continuum models. The identification of such microscale effects also has implications in possibly extending the limits of applicability of continuum models to higher Knudsen numbers.</dc:description><dc:publisher>E D P SCIENCES</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-21T12:02:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-21T12:02:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>EUROPHYSICS LETTERS, 68(6), 811-817</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0295-5075</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1209/epl/i2004-10296-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5861</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5861</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
