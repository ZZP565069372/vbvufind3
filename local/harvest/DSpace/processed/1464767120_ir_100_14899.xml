The tests were conducted on 2V:1H slope models under steady seepage condition at 50g. Surface settlements and pore water pressures at different locations were recorded during the test. The influence of anchor stiffness, anchor length, and anchor pretensioning were examined. With an increase in anchor strength or stiffness, a considerable decrease in crest settlements and face movements was observed. Further, pretensioning of strands was found to be effective in enhancing the efficiency of anchored geosynthetic systems. Limit equilibrium stability analyses were in good agreement with the experimental results of slope models at failure.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ICE PUBLISHING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T12:25:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T12:25:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>GEOSYNTHETICS INTERNATIONAL, 20(3)191-206</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1680/gein.13.00011</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14899</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
