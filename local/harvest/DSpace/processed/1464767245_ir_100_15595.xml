Native as well as cation exchanged Nafion membranes are found to protonate one of the two monoprotonated forms of 4PBI selectively. In native membranes and in those in which H3O+ ions are replaced by (CH3)(4)N+ ions, the pyridyl nitrogen is protonated preferentially. In Na+-exchanged membranes, however, the benzimidazole nitrogen is protonated selectively. Unlike other fluorescent probes used in earlier studies, 4PBI can differentiate between the two different cation-exchanged membranes at lower as well as higher hydration levels.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T12:52:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T12:52:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B, 116(33)9992-9998</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp303924a</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15595</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
