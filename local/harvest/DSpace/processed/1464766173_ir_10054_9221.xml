A generic strategy, namely specific interactions combined with reactive coupling, was adopted to facilitate and to retain the 'network-like' structure of MWNTs during melt-mixing. This was facilitated by the sodium salt of 6-amino hexanoic acid (Na-AHA) and certain phosphonium based modifiers, where it was envisaged that these modifiers would establish specific interactions (either 'cation-pi' or 'pi-pi') with the 'pi-electron' clouds of MWNTs, as well as restricting them in the PA6 phase of the blends via reactive coupling. This route eventually led to a remarkable increase in the electrical conductivity and dielectric constant in the blends with MWNTs. Raman, FTIR and TEM investigations further supported these observations.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IOP PUBLISHING LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-04T02:44:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-04T02:44:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>NANOTECHNOLOGY, 19(33), -</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0957-4484</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0957-4484/19/33/335704</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9221</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9221</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
