Flow stress first increases then decreases with an increase in test temperature, whereas ductility shows a sigmoidal relationship with the test temperature. The maximum ductility of about 80 pct is obtained at intermediate strain rate and 550 degrees C. Failure is noted to occur by cavity interlinkage and crack formation. Strain rate sensitivity (m) and activation energy (Q) for deformation are determined to be 0.04 to 0.13 and 96.2 to 157.4 kJ/mol, respectively. Toward lower test temperatures, both the m and Q are found to have lower values. Deformation at high temperature is suggested to be controlled by dislocation climb. However, under non-steady-state conditions due to cavitation, m and Q both vary with strain.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MINERALS METALS MATERIALS SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-18T18:35:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-18T18:35:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE, 27(8), 2274-2284</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1073-5623</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02651881</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10103</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10103</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
