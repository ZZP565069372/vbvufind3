The nature and and arrangement of periembryonic chambers are considered to be features of primary importance in classification. These. however, are not often visible for several reasons. In view of this. in the present study the nucleoconch shapes of the two subgenera are analyzed fur comparison. Well-prepared, oriented sections with periembryonic chambers clearly visible in the two subgenera are used for shape analysis of nuclcoconchs. The examined species include L.(E.) ephipoides, L.(N.) isolepidinoides and L.(N.) sumatrensis from the Oligocene-Miocene succession of Kutch. Results from closed form Fourier analysis revealed that the nucleoconchs of the two subgenera distinctly differ in shape. The 3rd, 4th and 5th harmonics are found to be significantly different in the power spectrum of the two subgenera. It is therefore concluded that Eulepidina nad Nephrolepidina are taxonomically valid subgenera. The Fourier shape analysis is also carried out for the nuclcoconchs of phylogenetically related species Lepidocyclina (Nephrolepidina) isolepidinoides, and Lepidocyclina (Nephrolepidina) sumatrensis. The results show that this method is also effective at species level differentiation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MICROPALEONTOLOGY PRESS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-18T18:16:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-18T18:16:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MICROPALEONTOLOGY, 47(1), 87-92</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0026-2803</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/47.1.87</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10098</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10098</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
