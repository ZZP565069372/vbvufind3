This culture could utilize diesel as the sole source of carbon and energy. Under aerobic conditions, 39% loss of diesel oil was observed over 8 days where 80% of the loss was due to aliphatic constituents. Under anoxic nitrate reducing conditions the rate and extent of degradation was significantly lower, i.e., 18% over 50 days. Salt acclimatized cultures could tolerate salinities up to 3.5% and demonstrated optimal performance at a salinity of 0.5%. The optimum N/P ratio for these cultures was found to be in the range of 2:1â€“5:1. Addition of two trace elemental substance formulations exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on culture growth. This culture has good potential for decontamination of oil-contaminated marine and subsurface environments.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-06-01T09:01:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-08T07:30:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:02:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-01T09:01:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-08T07:30:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:02:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Bioresource Technology 95(3), 281-286</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0960-8524</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1016/j.biortech.2004.02.029</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1403</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1403</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
