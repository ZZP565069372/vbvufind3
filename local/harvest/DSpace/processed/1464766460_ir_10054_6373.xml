The developed algorithm considers variable topology features and handles both adjacent and volumetric feature interactions to provide a single interpretation for the latter. The input CAD part model in B-Rep format is preprocessed to create the adjacency graphs for faces and features of associated topological entities and compute their attributes. The developed FR system initially recognizes all varieties of the simple and stepped holes with flat and conical bottoms from the feature graphs. A new concept of Base Explicit Feature Graphs and No-base Explicit Feature Graphs has been proposed which essentially delineates between features having planar base face like pockets, blind slots, etc. and those without planar base faces like passages, 3D features, conical bottom features, etc. Based on the structure of the explicit feature graphs, geometric reasoning rules are formulated to recognize the interacting feature types. Extracted data has been post-processed to compute the feature attributes and their parent-child relationships which are written into a STEP like native feature file format. The FR system was extensively tested with several standard benchmark components and was found to be robust and consistent. The extracted feature file can be used for integration with various downstream applications like CAPP. .</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-24T08:48:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-24T08:48:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY, 61(7), 686-701</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0166-3615</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2010.03.011</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/6373</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/6373</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
