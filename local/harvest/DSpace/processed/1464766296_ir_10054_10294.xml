Such a disposal system allows for the ash-water interaction. Alkalis present in the ash react with water, leading to zeolitization of the ash and changes in its overall properties. To simulate such interaction, controlled experiments have been conducted on a typical Indian lagoon ash, and the effect of zeolitization on the physicochemico-mineralogical properties has been studied. The effect of zeolitization on the geotechnical properties of the ash has also been investigated in detail. It is believed that such investigations are essential for bulk utilization of the lagoon ash, particularly as a fill material, where properties like compaction, consolidation, and hydraulic conductivity are very important.</dc:description><dc:publisher>NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-19T08:50:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:56:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:44:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-19T08:50:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:56:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:44:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL, 38(5), 1105-1112</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0008-3674</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cgj-38-5-1105</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10294</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10294</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
