In this context, linear stability model using homogenous flow was considered. Towards that, a linear stability model was developed using perturbation method. A characteristic equation (the response of pressure drop to a hypothetical perturbation in inlet velocity) obtained in this analysis, is shown to be a function of sub-cooling number, Zuber number, Froude number, friction number and inlet and outlet restriction coefficients. Then, a neutral dynamic stability curve is obtained using D-Partition approach. Similarly, static or excursive stability curve is also obtained from the characteristic equation. The derived analytical form for static and dynamic instability threshold is represented in the form of simplified correlations. The experimental data reported by other researchers agree well with these correlations. From the results, it is amply clear that for all practical purposes, two-phase cooling will be unstable. The question to be answered in future is, therefore, whether the oscillations that accompany can be tolerated from the application viewpoint.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T15:12:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T15:12:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>ICMM 2005: 3rd International Conference on Microchannels and Minichannels, Pt B,15-22</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7918-4185-5</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16045</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2640</dc:identifier><dc:source>3rd International Conference on Microchannels and Minichannels,Toronto, CANADA,JUN 13-15, 2005</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
