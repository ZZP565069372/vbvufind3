The thermal properties of these polyesters based on EDOT are comparable to those of conventional polyesters based on the 1,4-phenyl unit, indicating that EDOT is a viable replacement for the phenyl units. The glass-transition and melting-transition temperatures decrease monotonically with an increase in the spacer length. Theoretical calculations have revealed that the core angle for EDOT is comparable to that of unsubstituted thiophene and hence should be compatible with the formation of the mesophase. This has been confirmed experimentally by the synthesis of a main-chain, thermotropic, liquid-crystalline polyester based on EDOT that exhibits fluid birefringence. In fact, this is the first report in which a main-chain, liquid-crystalline polymer based on 3,4-disubstituted thiophene has been successfully designed and synthesized.
