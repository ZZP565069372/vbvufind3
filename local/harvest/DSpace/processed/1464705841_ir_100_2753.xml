Both constant load tests, under continuous cathodic charging, and constant extension tests of charged samples were carried out. Both the types of tests indicated that the susceptibility of the alloys towards HE to follow the order Grade 3 &gt; Grade 2 &gt; Grade 1 &gt; AISI 304. Cathodic hydrogen charging was found result in the appearance of epsilon(H) martensite in all the three Mn stainless steels, while the tensile test specimen fractured in air was found to contain stress induced alpha' martensite. Since the susceptibility of the alloy towards HE did not seem to correlate with H content of the alloy, the formation of epsilon(H) and alpha' martensites were suggested to be responsible for the higher susceptibility of Mn stainless steels towards HE.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T10:59:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T10:59:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>CORROSION AND ITS CONTROLS, VOLS I AND II,1074-1081</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-444-82916-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16274</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2753</dc:identifier><dc:source>International Conference on Corrosion (CORCON 97),MUMBAI, INDIA,DEC 03-06, 1997</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
