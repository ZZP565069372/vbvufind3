DibenzylProDOT (DiBz-ProDOT) and biphenylmethyloxymethyl ProDOT (BPMOM-ProDOT) were used as cathodically coloring polymers, whereas bis(2-(3,4-ethylenedioxy)thienyl)-N-methyl carbazole (BEDOT-NMCz) was used as their complementary anodically coloring polymer. Straightforward assembly of the devices was designed by means of using a UV photo-curable gel. These devices exhibited response speeds of approximately 1 s with photopic contrasts as high as 52% for the complete device, and were found to exhibit good stability under open circuit conditions. Convenience of reporting photopic values to characterize electrochromic devices compared to reporting contrasts at a single wavelength is remarked.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-02-24T07:20:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T17:40:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:06:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:54:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-02-24T07:20:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T17:40:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:06:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:54:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Synthetic Metals 157(6-7), 261-268</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0379-6779</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.synthmet.2007.03.003</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/757</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/757</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
