This bandwidth can be used to broadcast data and also products like video clips, software, multimedia packages. etc. thereby satisfying several customers,vith a single transmission at very high speeds. We present several heuristic algorithms that attempt to maximize the revenue earned by an E-commerce merchant providing such a service. These algorithms are tailored to deal with different customer service policies.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE COMPUTER SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T02:49:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T02:49:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>WECWIS 2000: SECOND INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON ADVANCED ISSUES OF E-COMMERCE AND WEB-BASED INFORMATION SYSTEMS, PROCEEDING,200-207</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7695-0611-9</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16215</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2508</dc:identifier><dc:source>2nd International Workshop on Advanced Issues of E-Commerce and Web-Base Information Systems (WECWIS 2000),MILPITAS, CA,JUN 08-09, 2000</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
