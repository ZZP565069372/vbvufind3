Surface hardness, measured by the Knoop indentation method under a load of 25 gf. phase analysis by the X-ray diffraction method and corrosion behaviour by the potentiodynamic measurement technique of these coatings have been evaluated. Surface hardness values were found to increase from about 1000-1100 for TiN coatings on mild steel to about 1800-1900 (HK25) for TiN coatings with chromium as interlayer. Potentiodynamic corrosion tests, performed in 1N H2SO4 solutions, have shown that with chromium interlayer the corrosion resistance increases significantly as compared to TiN only sputtered coatings on mild steel samples. No spalling of TiN coatings was observed during full sweep voltage of -1000 mV to +1000 mV when they were tested with a chromium interlayer.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INST METAL FINISHING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-03T09:59:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-03T09:59:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF METAL FINISHING, 77(), 196-199</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0020-2967</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8982</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8982</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
