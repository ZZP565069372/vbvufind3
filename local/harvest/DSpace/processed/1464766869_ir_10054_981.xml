Joints have been cast with adequate and deficient bond of reinforcements at the beam-column joint. FRP sheets and strips have been applied on the joints in different configurations. The columns are subjected to an axial force while the beams are subjected to a cyclic load with controlled displacement. The amplitude of displacement is increased monotonically using a dynamic actuator. The hysteretic curves of the specimens have been plotted. The energy dissipation capacity of various FRP configurations has been compared. In addition, the control specimens have been reused after testing as damaged specimens that are candidates for rehabilitation. The rehabilitation has been carried out using FRP and their performance has been compared with that of the undamaged specimens.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-03-19T05:10:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T19:26:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-03-19T05:10:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T19:26:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Composite Structures 70(2), 185-199</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0263-8223</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2004.08.022</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/981</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/981</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
