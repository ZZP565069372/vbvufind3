Far less is known on correlation effects in two-dimensional pi-conjugated systems. Here we present theoretical and experimental evidence for moderate repulsive electron electron interactions in a. number of finite polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules with D-6h symmetry. We show that the excited state orderings in these molecules are reversed relative to that expected within one-electron and mean-field theories. Our results reflect similarities as well as differences in the role and magnitude of electron correlation effects in these two-dimensional molecules compared to those in polyenes.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-29T05:48:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-29T05:48:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C, 118(6)3331-3339</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1932-7447</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp410793r</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17233</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
