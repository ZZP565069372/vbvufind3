Examples of such networks are wireless ad hoc networks of mobile computing devices or wired devices connected by a local area network. M2MC is useful for building a broad range of multiuser applications like multiplayer games, conversations, group ware systems. Unlike existing middleware architectures that rely on central servers, M2MC is truly distributed protocol. Applications developed using M2MC do not require central servers for message ordering, member synchronization and group management. Being broadcast oriented, M2MC do not require any resource consuming routing protocols. M2MC architecture comprises of Message Ordering Protocol, Member Synchronization Protocol and protocols for processes to join and leave the groups. In this paper we describe key components of M2MC and their implementation in Java.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T09:43:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T09:43:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>2006 1st International Conference on Communication Systems Software &amp; Middleware, Vols 1 and 2,323-332</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-0-7803-9574-9</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15972</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2570</dc:identifier><dc:source>1st International Conference on Communication Systems Software and Middleware,New Delhi, INDIA,JAN 08-12, 2006</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
