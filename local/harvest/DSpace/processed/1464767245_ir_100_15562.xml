Thus, the study of various conserved quantities on an event-by-event basis offers the possibility to study the phase transition and the nature of high density matter. The ALICE experiment is well suited for precise event-by-event measurements of various quantities. In this article, the event-by-event fluctuations of mean transverse momentum and net-charge distributions as measured by the ALICE experiment are presented.</dc:description><dc:publisher>PROGRESS THEORETICAL PHYSICS PUBLICATION OFFICE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T12:36:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T12:36:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article; Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS SUPPLEMENT, (193)301-305</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15562</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
