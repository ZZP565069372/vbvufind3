The effect of prior cold-work on RIS was also investigated. Samples with 0.00, 0.01, and 0.04 wt.% cerium were irradiated to 0.70 dpa using 4.8 MeV protons at 300 A degrees C. Characterization of proton-irradiated specimens was carried out using electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (EPR) test followed by atomic force microscopic examination. The specimen with prior cold-work (without cerium addition) showed the lowest EPR values indicating the lowest chromium depletion in this material. The specimen with 0.04 wt.% cerium showed the lower EPR value as compared to the specimen with 0.01 wt.% Ce. The irradiated specimen with prior cold-work showed linear features after the EPR tests and such features were attributed to decoration of dislocations, generated due to prior cold-work, by point defects produced during irradiation. The resistance to RIS offered by cold-work (linear features) has been more effective as compared to that by the addition of oversize solute addition.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:54:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:54:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE, 21(11)2472-2479</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11665-012-0201-8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/16118</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
