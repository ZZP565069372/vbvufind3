When fixed and variable costs are considered, then wind generation becomes an attractive alternative. With grid interconnection, one has to address the issues like interfacing, protection, tariff structure, transmission pricing, etc. While considering the tariff issues, the reduction in transmission and distribution (T and D) losses has a major role to play. Though it is known that T and D losses reduce with the placement of wind generator near the load, the reduction has to be quantified and its effect on tariff has to be adequately considered. There are other benefits like improvement in voltage, which also should be quantified.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-12-10T09:37:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T09:22:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:58:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-12-10T09:37:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T09:22:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:58:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>TENCON 2003: Proceedings of the Conference on Convergent Technologies for Asia-Pacific Region (V 2), Bangalore, India, 15-17 October, 2003, 775-779</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-8162-9</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1109/TENCON.2003.1273284</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/268</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/268</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
