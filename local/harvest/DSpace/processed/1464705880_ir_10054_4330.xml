Detailed ENDOR studies have been carried out on the two initially observed radicals. One of these radicals has been assigned to a protonated anion. Two protons, belonging to neighboring molecules, have been identified as transferred protons. The other radical is formed at the urea molecule by hydrogen abstraction from the methyl group. The observed completely transferred proton exhibits very small isotropic coupling. The third radical seen, only in aged crystals, after prolonged duration has been assigned to a R-CHOH type of radical. These results are compared to those from the urea oxalic acid systems.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER INST PHYSICS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-15T16:51:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-15T16:51:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>1992</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS, 97(2), 900-907</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0021-9606</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.463194</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4330</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4330</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
