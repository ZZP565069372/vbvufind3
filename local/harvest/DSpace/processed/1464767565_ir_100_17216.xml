Specifically, a pin-plate electrode system is used to emulsify castor oil into silicone oil. The method is suitable for the emulsification of a higher conductivity leaky dielectric oil dispersed in a lower conductivity medium and is suitable for an already existing emulsion, unlike electrospray methods. The process is stabilized by charging of the dispersed phase and the associated electrohydrodynamic flow. A balance of electrocoalescence and breakup leads to a stationary drop size distribution. A short process time indicates its suitability for continuous operation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-29T05:39:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-29T05:39:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDUSTRIAL &amp; ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH, 53(34)13488-13496</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0888-5885</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie5017893</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17216</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
