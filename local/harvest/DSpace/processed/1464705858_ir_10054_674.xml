lysimeters at near surface radioactive waste disposal facility, RSMS Trombay site. The soil type of the site was
clayey sand with appreciable quantity of montmorillonite. The studies were performed in two lysimeters separated
by a distance of 50m. Radionuclides 3H (20 MBq), 137Cs (0.55MBq) and 60Co (0.40MBq) were doped as a tracer
in sand layer placed at 100-200 mm from top of the surface of lysimeters along with the inactive salt solution of
CsNO3 and Co(NO3).6H2O. Pore water samplers at different depths and Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) were
installed in the lysimeter. Periodically pore water samples were extracted using hand operated vacuum pump and
the samples were analysed for radionuclides present. After rainy season the soil was cored up to a depth of
55cm and analysed for radionuclides migration depth wards. Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer and high resolution
Gamma Ray Spectrometer were used for isotopic activity analysis. The study revealed that under normal
environmental condition, 3H migrated nearly 40 cm in 14 days of simulated rainfall condition; however 137Cs and
60Co did not show any significant migration even in nearly 500 days.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IACMAG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-02-17T12:06:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T07:26:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:57:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-02-17T12:06:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T07:26:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:57:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Proceedings of the 12th IACMAG: Geomechanics in the Emerging Social &amp; Technological Age, Goa, India, 1-6 October 2008, 2320-2326</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/674</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/674</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
