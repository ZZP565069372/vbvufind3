We show that these are precisely the set functions that can be extended to convex (concave) functionals over R-+(S). We characterize such functions and show that if they have certain additional desirable properties, they are forced to become submodular/supermodular. We study pt and dpt functions using the notion of a legal dual generator (LDG) structure which is a refinement of the sets of generator vectors of the dual cones associated with the faces of the set polyhedron. We extend f (g) to convex and concave functionals on R-S by f(cup)(c) equivalent to max(x is an element of Pf) c(T)x, g(cap)(c) equivalent to min (g)(x is an element of P) c(T)x. We then show a refinement (in terms of LDG) of the following discrete separaton theorem. Theorem 0.1. If f is polyhedrally tight, g is dually polyhedrally tight and f &gt;= g and P-f and P-g have the same dual cones associated with their faces, then f(cup) &gt;= g(cap) and there exists a modular function h s.t. f &gt;= h &gt;= g.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-27T10:41:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:56:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:46:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-27T10:41:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:56:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:46:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS, 402(), 74-100</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0024-3795</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.laa.2004.12.008</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/7202</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/7202</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
