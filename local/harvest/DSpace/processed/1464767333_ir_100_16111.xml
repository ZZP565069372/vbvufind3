The experiments were carried out for a range of equivalence ratios and mixture temperatures. Computational predictions of the burning velocity and detailed flame structure were performed using the PREMIX code with USC mech 2.0. The present data are in very good agreement with both the recent experimental and computational results available. A peak burning velocity was observed for slightly rich mixtures, even at higher mixture temperatures. The minimum value of th temperature exponent is observed for slightly rich mixtures.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ASME</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:50:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:50:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME, 135(9)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0742-4795</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1528-8919</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4024798</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/16111</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
