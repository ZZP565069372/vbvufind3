Non-uniform settlements lead to bending and are critical for the behaviour of clay liners. As a result, the clay liner could loose its integrity and sealing efficiency. In this paper, relevance of centrifuge modeling technique for studying affect of non-uniform settlements on the integrity of the CCL of a liner system is presented. The centrifuge tests were carried out at 50g by simulating non-uniform settlements of a landfill using a trap-door arrangement. In addition the possibility of using a geogrid layer within the CCL to retain the integrity is brought out.</dc:description><dc:publisher>WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T20:59:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T20:59:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>Proceedings of the Twelfth Asian Regional Conference on Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Vol 1 and 2,1299-1301</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>981-238-559-2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16126</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2707</dc:identifier><dc:source>12th Asian Regional Conference on Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (12ARC),Singapore, SINGAPORE,AUG 04-08, 2003</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
