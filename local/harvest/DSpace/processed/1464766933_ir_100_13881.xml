However, available models suffer from various drawbacks, the main one being that they do not show the right asymptotic behavior for large number of contact points. A model is presented here, that corrects these deficiencies. The results show that the contact-point model approaches particle-continuum behavior whenever the number of contact points exceeds 500. The model predictions have been compared with some data from our previous work on calcia-alumina system in the temperature range 1,150-1,300 degrees C. The model fits the data well, with the fitted values of diffusivity (of calcia through alumina) being of the order of 10(-16) m(2)/s.
