The observed almost twofold relative change in the electron mobility is considerably larger than that reported before for pentacene-based OFETs. Moreover, the strain dependency of electron mobility in C-60 films is strongly anisotropic with respect to the strain direction measured relative to the current flow. Analysis within a hopping-transport model for OFET mobility suggests that the observed strain dependency on electron transport is dominated mostly by the change of inter-grain coupling in polycrystalline C-60 films.
