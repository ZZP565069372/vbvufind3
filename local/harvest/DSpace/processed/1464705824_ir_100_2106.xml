The problem involves complex issues relating to large-scale production in a hybrid flowshop configuration, decisions relating to minimizing trim losses, while maintaining on-time delivery of orders. Due to these complexities, the overall problem of integrated planning and scheduling is logically partitioned into several levels, depending on the problem size. As followed in other decomposition-based approaches, the Upper level models are equipped with appropriate abstractions of the lower level constraints. Also from a reactive scheduling point of view, some pro-active measures are embedded into the multi-level structure. The proposed multi-level decomposition scheme is demonstrated on a representative planning and scheduling problem.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-24T05:35:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-24T05:35:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>European Symposium on Computer-Aided Process Engineering-15, 20A and 20B,20a-20b,1621-1626</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-444-51987-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1570-7946</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15339</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2106</dc:identifier><dc:source>15th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE-15),Barcelona, SPAIN,MAY 29-JUN 01, 2005</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
