The entire ballistic impact event considering target performance can be divided into dynamic plastic penetration, spherical bulge formation, bulge advancement, plug formation and exit and projectile exit. Velocity, displacement, force, deceleration of the projectile and energy absorbed by the target as a function of time are evaluated. Typical experiment studies were carried out on a ballistic impact test apparatus up to incident kinetic energy of 85 J. A very good correlation was observed between the analytical predictions and the experimental observations in terms of ballistic limit velocity and energy absorbing mechanisms. The significant observation is that the targets with two different thicknesses can give the same ballistic limit velocity with all the other conditions remaining the same. This behavior is explained based on different prominent energy absorbing mechanisms with different target thicknesses. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
