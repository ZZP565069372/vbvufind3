Ethics for him is an enquiry into what is most valuable in one's life; a very personal experience of values woven around the individual subject. We analyse the true nature of ethical in Wittgenstein's writings and argue that it can only be understood through a close examination of the relation he proposes between self and the world. Our argument is rooted around his unique notion of solipsism without a solipsistic self. This distinctive ontological relationship between self and the world explicates moral significance into the world and how morality is defined as deeply felt personal responses to life.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER INDIA</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-14T12:50:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-14T12:50:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF INDIAN COUNCIL OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH, 32(1)109-121</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0970-7794</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>2363-9962</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40961-015-0010-1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17540</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
