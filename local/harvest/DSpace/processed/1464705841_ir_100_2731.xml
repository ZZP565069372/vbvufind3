The tools and dies required for injection moulding are themselves complex and in order to process these, the technology of rapid prototyping (RP) or solid free-form fabrication (SFF) etc. has come into vogue. Essentially, a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of the required free-form is created and converted into STL ( after the process Stereo Lithography for which 3D systems developed this format) format. The latter is sliced into thin cross-sectional layers and the output is fed to the rapid prototyping machine which then builds the free-form, one layer atop another. The free-form is then sintered to yield the final product. During the past decade, RP has evolved into a class of technologies such as stereo-lithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), solid ground curing (SGC), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), fused deposition modelling (FDM), inkjet printing, etc. Not only can solid free forms be fabricated using these techniques, but functionally gradient materials (FGM) with properties varying from the surface to the interior, as well as composite materials, can also be advantageously made. The RP techniques are extensively used in processing ceramics and ceramic-polymer composites. The most popular techniques for metal powders are FDM and SLS. The latter often uses metal powders along with polymers. Complex shapes such as gears, turbine blades, etc. are produced. The technology however is in the early stages as far as Powder Metallurgy applications are concerned. It poses considerable challenges to the powder producers who are likely to concentrate on production of inks, gels, pastes and powder blends etc. in the future, which are required as feed materials for the RP techniques. The other feed materials which need to be developed will be in the form of metal powder-polymer blends, wires, rods, granules etc. The present paper discusses various RP processes and their applications to fabrication of automotive PM components.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SCIENCE PUBLISHERS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T22:46:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T22:46:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>POWDER METALLURGY IN AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS-II,49-62</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1-57808-267-6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16154</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2731</dc:identifier><dc:source>International Conference on Powder Metallurgy for Automobile Components (PM02),INDIA,</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
