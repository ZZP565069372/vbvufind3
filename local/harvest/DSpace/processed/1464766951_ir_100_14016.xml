Heat recovery from flue gas (1350-1500 degrees C) is usually in the form of combustion air pre-heating (900-1200 degrees C) using a regenerator. Dust from flue gas which is carried over from the furnace gets deposited in the regenerator storage matrix path. This leads to a deterioration of regenerator efficiency. A regenerator model is developed to estimate the actual performance of the regenerator and to compare it with the target performance. The proposed model is based on mass and energy balance of streams along with heat transfer characteristic equations. The model is illustrated for a 130 TPD (Ton per Day) furnace regenerator of an industrial glass plant at Mumbai, India. Model results for the regenerator studied indicate a blockage of 50% on the doghouse side and 22% on the non-doghouse side of the regenerator. The actual performance of the regenerator is found to be 7% lower than its target performance for the doghouse side regenerator. The model developed can also be used in other industrial sectors like steel, chemical etc. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
