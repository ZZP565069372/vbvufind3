It is important to note that quite often the data that is broadcast is time-critical in nature. Most of the related current research focuses on a pure push-based approach ( Broadcast Disks model), where the transmission of data is done without allowing explicit requests from the users. More recently, some bidirectional models incorporating a low-capacity uplink channel have been proposed in order to increase the functionality of the Broadcast Disks model. However, the impact of integration of the uplink channel has been investigated using only static client profiles or ignoring the existence of time-sensitive data. None of the existing models integrates all the characteristics needed to perform effectively in a real-world, dynamic time-critical asymmetric communication environment. In this paper we present an adaptive data dissemination model and the associated on-line scheduling algorithms. These improve the functionality and performance of bidirectional broadcast models, maximizing the total number of satisfied users in asymmetric communication environments with dynamic client profiles and time requirements ( e. g., mobile systems). This is achieved by means of dynamic adaptation of the broadcast program to the needs of the users, taking into account the bandwidth constraints inherent in asymmetric communication environments and the deadline requirements of the user requests. Performance is evaluated by simulation of a real-time asymmetric communication environment.</dc:description><dc:publisher>KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-17T03:22:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:44:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-17T03:22:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:44:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MOBILE NETWORKS &amp; APPLICATIONS, 9(5), 491-505</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1383-469X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:MONE.0000034703.41393.aa</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9723</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9723</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
