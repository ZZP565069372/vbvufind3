Electrical conductivity measurements were made using complex impedance method. The electrical conductivity and conductivity relaxation of the system were studied in the temperature range from 303 K to 333 K and in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 10 MHz. The highest conductivity at room temperature is obtained for the system with modifier to former ratio 1.75. Impedance and modulus analyses had indicated the temperature independent distribution of relaxation times and the non-Debye behavior in these materials. The co-operative motion due to strong coupling between the mobile Ag+ ions is assumed to give rise to non-Debye type of relaxation. The silver ionic transport number (t(Ag+)) obtained by the emf technique suggested the occurrence of silver ion conduction in the CdI2-doped Ag2O-V2O5-B2O3 system.
