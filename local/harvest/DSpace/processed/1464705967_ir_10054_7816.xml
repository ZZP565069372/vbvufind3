Blade surface pressure distribution, diffusion factor and loss coefficients were evaluated at the midspan with zero tip clearance and with 3% of chord tip clearance. Experimental observation shows significant variation on the surface pressure distributions; however, this variation was not reflected in the cascade loss coefficients measured across the midspan. It is believed that the clearance creates a strong spanwise flow, extending its effect to the midspan section, where growth of surface boundary layer due to combined chordwise and spanwise flow has been controlled by the controlled diffusion characteristics, of the airfoil profile. As a result, the usually expected additional loss has not been experienced.</dc:description><dc:publisher>FREUND PUBLISHING HOUSE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-29T20:07:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-29T20:07:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>1995</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TURBO &amp; JET-ENGINES, 12(3), 223-229</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0334-0082</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/7816</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/7816</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
