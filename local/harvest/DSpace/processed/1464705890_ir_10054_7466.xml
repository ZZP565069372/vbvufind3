The bulk texture development for both reduction percentages, during subsequent recrystallization were similar and can be summarized as an increase in texturing at the initial stages (till 10-15% recrystallization) and a drop beyond 20-24% recrystallization. Microtexture measurements revealed three types of recrystallized/recovered grains: (I) Grains originating from strain localizations: These were textured and their orientations fell within an approximate band of negative textural softening; (II) Grains originating from 'deformed bands': These were of randomized orientations, originating from well recovered stretches-generalized as 'deformed bands'; (III) Extended recovery: This was observed for selective grains/orientations-orientations broadly linked with positive textural softening. The first type of grains dominated the early recrystallization stages and their preferred presence (or frequency advantage) was responsible for the increased texturing. The observed randomization at the subsequent-stages of recrystallization was caused by the size advantage of the recrystallized grains originating from the 'deformed bands'.
