The wheat seeds were grown for 72h in different concentrations 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1200 ppm) of herbicides at normal laboratory temperature (25+/-2 degrees C) and light condition. The parameters like seedling morphology, seed germination percent and root length were studied and the parameters were analyzed statistically by SPSS ver. 16. The results indicated that both herbicides were able to induce bulbous structure in wheat seedlings at 400-1200 ppm. The seed germination percent and root length (cm) gradually decreased from lower to higher concentrations. The overall result showed that both herbicides had dose dependant effects on seedlings of wheat varieties. Further, the herbicides 2, 4-Dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2, 4-D), isoproturon (IPU) and their combinations (2, 4-D+IPU) were used to study their phyto-morphological effects on wheat. The morphological parameters were taken as leaf area (cm(2)), internode length (cm), shoot length (cm), shoot biomass (FWg(-1) plant(-1)), shoot biomass (DWg(-1) plant(-1)) and seed weight (g inflorescense(-1)). The different concentrations applied singly or in combinations, as expected, showed phyto-depressive effects on morphological parameters studied.</dc:description><dc:publisher>RESEARCH JOURNAL BIOTECHNOLOGY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T10:31:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T10:31:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, 7(4)232-249</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14752</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
