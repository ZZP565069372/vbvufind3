The electronic structures of the isolated forms (NBu4)(2)[(acac)(2)Ru(mu-E)Ru(acac)(2)] ( (NBu4)(2)[1]), (bpy)(2)Ru(mu-E)Ru(bpy)(2)]ClO4 ([2]ClO4), and [(pap)(2)Ru(mu-E)Ru(pap)(2)] ([3]) were characterized by density functional theory (DFT) in conjunction with EPR and UV vis NIR measurements. The crystal structure of (NBu4)(2)[1] revealed the meso form and a largely planar Ru(itE)Ru center. Several additional charge states of the compounds were electrochemically accessible and were identified mostly as complexes with noninnocently behaving pap(0/center dot-) or bridging ellagate (En-) anions (n = 2, 3, 4) but not as mixed-valence intermediates. The free anions En-, n = 1-4, were calculated by time-dependent DFT to reveal NIR transitions for the radical forms with n = 1 and 3 and a triplet ground state for the bis(o-semiquinone) dianion E2-.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:07:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:07:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 54(20)10049-10057</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0020-1669</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1520-510X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b01868</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17891</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
