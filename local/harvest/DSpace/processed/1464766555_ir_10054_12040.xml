Results show that the jet length increases linearly with the square-root of time, over a wide range of Reynolds number calculated with respect to the jet diameter. The celerity factor, x(f)/tU, has been found to be nearly constant at 2.47 throughout with a 5% variance. Here, x(f) is the jet length, t is the time and U is the jet exit velocity. These results compare favourably with earlier results reported at lower Reynolds numbers. Finally, we present a simple model based on the integral energy balance of the turbulent boundary layer equation for an impulsively started turbulent axisymmetric jet. The model predicts a jet length that scales as, (x(f)/d) = root(9B/10)(tU/d) where d is the nozzle diameter and B(approximate to 6.0) is the velocity-decay constant. This gives a celerity factor, alpha equivalent to root 9B/10 = 2.32 in close agreement with the experiments.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T09:18:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T09:18:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B, 61(3), 293-297</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1434-6028</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjb/e2008-00068-2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12040</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12040</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
