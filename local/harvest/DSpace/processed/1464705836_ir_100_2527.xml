Silica-insulin nanocomposite (SINC) and ferrite coated SINC (FeSINC) prepared by polyelectrolytic condensation of silica precursor on insulin were studied for their ability to control glucose levels. SINC was prepared by acid- base catalysed polymerization in presence of insulin at room temperature by modified Stober's process. FeSINC nanoparticles were prepared by co-precipitation of both ferric and ferrous salts on the bovine insulin loaded silica nanoparticle. The presence of ferrite coating in FeSINC was identified using VSM and quantified from XRF study. The intermolecular interactions in these nanocomposites were studied by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. An in vivo study indicated that FeSINC was biologically active in reducing glucose levels as compared to SINC.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CRC PRESS-TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS GROUP</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-25T23:00:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-25T23:00:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>NSTI NANOTECH 2008, VOL 1, TECHNICAL PROCEEDINGS,770-773</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-1-4200-8503-7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15840</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2527</dc:identifier><dc:source>Nanotechnology Conference and Trade Show (Nanotech 2008),Boston, MA,JUN 01-05, 2008</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
