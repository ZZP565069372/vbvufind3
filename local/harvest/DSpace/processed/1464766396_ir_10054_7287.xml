Dimple fracture was present in all four materials but the dimples were larger and of more uniform size in LPG steel compared with those present in the Al-alloys. Depending on the relative strength of pearlite and pearlite-matrix interface, failure in LPG steel was either transgranular or ductile intergranular. In the Al-alloys, particle-matrix decohesion was always responsible for dimple formation and transgranular fracture. In the Al-Cu-Mg and AI-Mg alloys a bimodal dimple size distribution, traceable to precipitates of two different sizes, was present but in the AI-Mn alloy the dimple size was larger and of nearly the same size. The results are explained in terms of composition, microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloys.
