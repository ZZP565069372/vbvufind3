Synthesised Pani-PAmAc particles were investigated using TEM, FTIR, TGA and conductivity, whilst coatings were also physically examined using SEM. The corrosion performance of coatings was studied using a combination of potentiodynamic polarisation, EIS, and salt spray test. Results reveal that the epoxy based Pani-PAmAc coating was smooth and continuous. Potentiodynamic polarisation, EIS and salt spray testing revealed significant corrosion protection even after 50 days exposure to a 3.5% NaCl environment. This was attributed to the synergistic effect of polyaniline with poly(acrylamide co-acrylic acid) which prevented dopant loss and maintained electronic conduction even after long term exposure to a corrosive environment.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ESG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T13:14:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T13:14:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE, 8(3)3132-3149</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15639</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
