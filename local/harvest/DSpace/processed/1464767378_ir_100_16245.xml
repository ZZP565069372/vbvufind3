The ion recognition properties of these receptors were studied using fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. The receptors were found to be sensitive and selective towards Cu2+ in methanol solution among the 13 metal ions studied, namely Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+, by exhibiting switch off fluorescence. The stoichiometry of the complexed species was found to be 2:1. The fluorescence quenching with Cu2+ is in the order of L-1 &gt; L-2 &gt; L-3. These conjugates were also found to act as coloriraetric sensors for Cu2+ in solution by exhibiting visual colour change. The 2:1 complex shows a centrosymmetric structure based on DFT computations.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-28T09:06:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-28T09:06:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL SCIENCES, 126(4)1135-1141</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0974-3626</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0973-7103</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/16245</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
