These complexes were characterized by chemical analysis, IR and proton NMR spectroscopy. A detailed study on the absorption spectroscopy of these complexes was made. These complexes were found to show a low-energy solvatochromic ligand-to-ligand charge-transfer (LLCT) band. The electronic energies of these bands have been analyzed and compared with electrochemical data. Emission behaviour of the complexes of the series, [Pt(N-N)(DHB)], [Pt(N-N)(DHBA)] {where DHBA is the dianion of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid} and [Pt-2(BPY)(2)(THB)] was also investigated. These platinum complexes were found to emit from a low-energy state at low temperature and a high-energy state at room temperature. Photophysics of these complexes is also discussed.
