IRS-1A LISS 2 data for April, May, and June in 1988 and 1991, and November and December in 1990 and January in 1991 have been analysed to generate albedo and vegetation indices. Rainfall data for a period of 70 years (1922-1991) at 22 stations were used to define isohyetal maps. Soil moisture was calculated using meteorological equations. The Survey of India topomap was used as input for slope analysis. The data surfaces were studied together with the aid of a geographical information system and the final output was produced in the form of a raster image to high-light the different degrees of severity of drought in the region.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER-VERLAG WIEN</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-30T12:45:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-30T12:45:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY, 58(1-2), 105-112</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0177-798X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00867437</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12321</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12321</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
