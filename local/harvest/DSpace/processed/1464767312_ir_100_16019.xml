The Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) was maintained as 24 hours in all the reactors. The granular biomass in the test reactors R2 and R3 were acclimated to 40 mg/L of TCA and 20 mg/L of TeCA, respectively. The effluent TCA and TeCA concentrations were 0.03 mg/L and 0.18 mg/L, respectively, at the end of acclimation phase. Sodium acetate and ethanol both were found to be suitable as the primary substrates in the biodegradation of TCA and TeCA. However, lower concentrations of the toxic pollutants (TCA and TeCA) were obtained in the effluents with the use of sodium acetate. The COD removal efficiency in the test reactors (R2 and R3) varied in the range of 95% to 98.2% accompanied by the formation of 1,2-Dichloroethane (DCA) as the major intermediate.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:03:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:03:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, 47(4)638-644</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2012.650586</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/16019</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
