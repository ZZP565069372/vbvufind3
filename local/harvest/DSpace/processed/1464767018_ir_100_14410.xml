The campus has three distinct zones, namely the institutional zone, the residential zone and the hostel zone.  Each zone has been analysed using EPANET for their adequacy, separately and as a whole.  The analysis was carried out for peak demand and average demand conditions. It is found that the present system is adequate and that it can be managed with proper timing of operation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Indian Water Works Association</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-09-12T11:06:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-09-12T11:06:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Journal of Indian Water Works Association, XXXII(2) 116-131</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0970-275X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14410</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
