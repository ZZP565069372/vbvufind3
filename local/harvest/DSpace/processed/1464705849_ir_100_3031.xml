Their applications have been found for all routes of drug delivery. These micro and nano structures are containers loaded with drugs, ideal for targeted and sustained release of the drug. Drug efficacy depends on the drug loaded into the vehicle, temperature, drug solubility, pH, release characteristics, additives and most significantly, the vehicle morphology. This in turn suggests that the same vehicle cannot be used with high efficiency for all types of drugs and locations where the drug delivery has to take place. The status of various self assembled structures and their applications in drug delivery is reviewed in this communication.</dc:description><dc:publisher>NATL INST SCIENCE COMMUNICATION</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-12T13:54:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-12T13:54:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Review</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,45(2)133-159</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0019-5189</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/13792</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/3031</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
