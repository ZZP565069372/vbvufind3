The state of dispersion of MWNT in the blends was assessed through AC electrical conductivity measurements and melt-rheological investigations. The electrical and rheological percolation threshold in PA6/ABS blends was similar to 3-4 and similar to 1-2 wt% MWNT, respectively. A unique reactive modifier (sodium salt of 6-amino hexanoic acid, Na-AHA) was employed to facilitate 'network-like' structure of MWNT and to confine them in a specific phase. This was achieved by establishing specific interactions with the delocalized 'pi-electron' clouds of MWNT and melt-interfacial reaction during melt-mixing. The electrical percolation threshold was significantly reduced in the blends (similar to 0.25 wt%) in the presence of Na-AHA modified MWNT and even coincided with the rheological percolation threshold. Significant refinement in the co-continuous structure was also observed in the presence of Na-AHA modified MWNT.
