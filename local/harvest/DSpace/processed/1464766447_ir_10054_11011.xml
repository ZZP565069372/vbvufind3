Photoluminescence (PL), thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies were carried out on gamma-irradiated doped/undoped yttrium borate samples in the temperature range 300-600K. TSL studies showed the presence of two glow peaks at 414 and 471 K. PL studies along with lifetime decay investigation suggested uranium goes in the matrix as UO(2)(2+). EPR studies showed the presence of O(2)(-)radical ion along with electron trapped in defect centres, which might have been produced for charge compensation. Apart from this, CO(2)(-) radical was also observed in the system having its origin from residual oxalate ion. Temperature dependence EPR studies of the observed radical confirmed the involvement of the CO(2)(-) and dioxide radical ion in the observed glow peaks. By correlating the TSL, PL and ESR data, probable mechanism is proposed for the observed TSL glow in the system.
