A subset U-i of the vertex set is said to d-dominate G(i) if in G(i), all the vertices are at distance at most d from some vertex in U-i. Alon et al. [Discrete Math., 262 (2003), pp. 17-25] introduced and studied a function mu(k), which is defined as the minimum radius of domination d such that the vertex set of every graph with a collection of k spanning subgraphs can be partitioned into U-1, U-2,..., U-k such that Ui d-dominates Gi. They proved that mu(k) &lt; 3/2 k, and the proof yields a polynomial time algorithm for the same. We prove that the problem is NP-complete, and we also answer a question from their paper by improving their bound to (3/2-epsilon)k. We also present an algorithm which finds such a coloring in polynomial time.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SIAM PUBLICATIONS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T05:20:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T05:20:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>SIAM JOURNAL ON DISCRETE MATHEMATICS, 21(4), 1071-1082</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0895-4801</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/060662307</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11974</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11974</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
