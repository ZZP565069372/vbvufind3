We develop new and exact analytical models to estimate travel distance for random, full turnover and class-based storage in which a single picker follows an S-shaped traversal routeing policy. Our analytical results for random, full turnover and class-based storage follow corresponding simulations very closely with an accuracy of within 2% for the range of warehouse parameters considered. We also report the percentage improvement obtained by the optimal 3-class storage strategy over the random storage policy and the potential gain of this 3-class policy as compared to the full turnover policy. Further, we conduct a computational study to determine the optimal layout parameters for a warehouse with a 3-class optimal storage strategy for a given pick size per tour. Sensitivity analysis of pick travel distances with important warehouse parameters is also presented.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T12:03:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T12:03:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH, 51(16)4979-4996</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2013.784419</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14857</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
