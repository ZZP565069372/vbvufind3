These rules are supposed to produce the forms that are used in the language, i.e. Sanskrit. However, sometimes the technical application of these rules produces such forms which are not actually used in the language. In fact, sometimes it is beyond human capacities to use such forms. In the present paper two such cases dealing with the phonological overgeneration axe studied and possible solutions are proposed to avoid the problem.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-30T12:03:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-30T12:03:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>SANSKRIT COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, INVITED PAPERS, 5402(), 306-319</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0302-9743</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12307</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12307</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
