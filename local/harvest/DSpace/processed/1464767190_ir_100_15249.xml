More importantly due to the presence magnetoelectric coupling, the BDFO inductor could be tuned magnetically as well as electrically. It is observed that tunability of this inductor is better in the presence of magnetic field than electrical field. This behaviour is correlated to high electrical loss factor (tan delta) of the core material. The dissipation of electrical energy perhaps impedes the strain induced change in permeability. However, there are chances of improvement if tan delta of BDFO is controlled. Nevertheless, simplicity in fabrication and flexibility in operation make tunable BDFO inductors attractive for novel applications. The results give confidence to work on development of miniaturization of BDFO inductor.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IOP PUBLISHING LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T16:48:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T16:48:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS, 46(32)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0022-3727/46/32/325001</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15249</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
