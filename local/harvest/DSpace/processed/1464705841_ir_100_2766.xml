The response of any natural surface slope is governed by a number of factors such as the geometry of the slope, elastic properties of the material of the slope and direction and nature of the incident waves. In the present paper the effect of Poisson's ratio, on the response of slopes having typical geometry and subjected to vertically incident SV-waves is studied. The calculations are based on the principles of propagation of waves in homogeneous elastic medium and their reflection at the surface which comprises the slope profile and the horizontal planar surfaces on both sides. A parametric study of the responses of the surfaces of slopes having different slope angles and Poisson's ratios is made. The results are presented and discussed with a view to assess the likelihood of slope surface failures.</dc:description><dc:publisher>A A BALKEMA PUBLISHERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T11:51:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T11:51:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>COMPUTER METHODS AND ADVANCES IN GEOMECHANICS, VOL 3,1705-1708</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>90-5410-907-6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16289</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2766</dc:identifier><dc:source>9th International Conference on Computer Methods and Advances in Geomechanics,WUHAN, PEOPLES R CHINA,NOV 02-07, 1997</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
