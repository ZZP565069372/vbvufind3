X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to characterise the deposits. High-resolution electron microscopic (HREM) examination revealed that deposited nc alloys were dense in nature. Corrosion behaviour of both nc as well as Monel-400 were compared in 3.0 wt.% NaCl solution and was found that corrosion current density (icorr) of nc alloys were superior to Monel-400. Both optical as well as scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination of the corroded surface revealed a well-defined pitting type of attack for Monel-400 unlike nc alloys; akin to homogeneous corrosion.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-06-04T09:14:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-08T07:38:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:02:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-04T09:14:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-08T07:38:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:02:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Journal of Alloys and Compounds  426(1-2), 235-243</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0925-8388</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1016/j.jallcom.2005.12.094</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1418</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1418</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
