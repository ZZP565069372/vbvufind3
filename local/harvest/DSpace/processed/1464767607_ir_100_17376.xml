The eight axially silyloxy-substituted B-III complexes of smaragdyrins were freely soluble in common organic solvents and were characterized by HRMS, 1D and 2D NMR, absorption, fluorescence and electrochemical studies, as well as by X-ray crystallography in the case of one of the complexes. The crystal structure revealed that the smaragdyrin macrocycle is almost planar and that the -OSiMe3 groups on B-III are oriented in the up and down directions relative to the macrocycle. The absorption studies indicated that the axially silyloxy-substituted B-III smaragdyrins are strongly absorbing in the 710-440 nm region with absorption coefficients higher than those of B(OH)(2)-smaragdyrin complexes. The silylation of -OH groups at the B-III centre in the B-III smaragdyrin complex results in five- to sixfold enhancements in the fluorescence quantum yields and in longer singlet state lifetimes. Thus, the axial silyloxy B-III complexes are strongly fluorescent with quantum yields in the 0.65-0.78 range and singlet state lifetimes in the 4.3-4.9 ns range. The complexes are highly stable under redox conditions and each exhibit two reversible oxidations and one reversible reduction.</dc:description><dc:publisher>WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-14T10:36:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-14T10:36:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY(29)4810-4818</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1434-1948</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1099-0682</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejic.201500718</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17376</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
