Both finite-element analysis and experimental investigations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the Tripod and Tetrapod actuators. When operated at 0.57 kV mm(-1), both actuators exhibit an axial displacement of nearly 60 mu m. Blocking forces of about 10 N and 14 N are observed for the Tripod and the Tetrapod, respectively. The blocking forces are roughly doubled if the perfectly clamped condition is imposed for the legs at the pedestal end while the axial displacement is lowered marginally by 12%. In addition to small footprints, other attractive features of the actuators include greater flexibility to modify the leg geometry and their inclination to suit the application.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IOP PUBLISHING LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T08:18:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T08:18:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES, 21(6)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0964-1726/21/6/065015</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14664</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
