Four cobalt based glasses: C-1924, 6025X, 6025 and 6030 (Vitrovac(R) codes) have been used in as-spun and annealed states. The corrosion behaviour was studied by electrochemical polarization as well as by the weight loss methods. The 6025X glass was found to have the best corrosion resistance as measured by corrosion current density. The corrosion rate was found to vary linearly with NaCl concentration. Annealing at 673K for 1-hr was found to improve the corrosion resistance.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T10:08:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T10:08:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>CORROSION AND ITS CONTROLS, VOLS I AND II,1251-1256</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-444-82916-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16261</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2742</dc:identifier><dc:source>International Conference on Corrosion (CORCON 97),MUMBAI, INDIA,DEC 03-06, 1997</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
