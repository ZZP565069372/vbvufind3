The wear resistance of pure PEEK is 10-fold higher than mild steel. It was further improved by 2-fold at 20 wt % micro-AlN and by more than 4-fold at 30 wt % nano-AlN composite compared with pure PEEK. The improvement in wear resistance was attributed to a thin and coherent transfer film. However, it was deteriorated on further increasing micro-AlN. The coefficient of friction of the composites was increased. Scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy of worn surfaces and transfer films have been explained in detail.
