Maximum COD reduction of 77.3% was obtained at 423 K at pH 3.0, which was marginally higher than that obtained at 413 K temperature (77.1%). In the acidic environment (pH &lt;= 3), most of the COD was removed in the form of settleable solids during the transient heating of the wastewater from room temperature to the desired one. The solid residue obtained after the reaction has a heating value of 20.1 MJ/kg, which is comparable with that of Indian coal. Thermal degradation kinetic determination suggested that thermal characteristics of the solid residue are well represented by a power law model with Agarwal and Sivasubramanian approximation (Safi et al., 2004).</dc:description><dc:publisher>WATER ENVIRONMENT FEDERATION</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-09-01T10:12:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-09-01T10:12:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH, 80(2), 136-141</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1061-4303</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143007X220752</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12746</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12746</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
