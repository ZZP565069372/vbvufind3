It starts with a set of observations obtained from a given sample, analyzing this set of observation with their inter-correlations to determine whether the variations represented can be accounted for adequately by a number of basic categories smaller than that with which the investigation was started. Factor analysis is applied to identify the latent constructs in the subjects being offered at a business school. The significance of this study is to get some insight on the course design of the prevailing academic curriculum.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-31T12:32:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:40:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-31T12:32:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:40:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SERVICE OPERATIONS AND LOGISTICS, AND INFORMATICS, (), 357-362</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8121</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8121</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
