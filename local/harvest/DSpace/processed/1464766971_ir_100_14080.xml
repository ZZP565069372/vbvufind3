Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies reveal that copper ion in all the three complexes is bonded to two phosphoryl ions (P(O)O ) and two pyridine co-ligands. The crystal structure of 1 reveals that the hydroxyl group of the CH(2)CH(2)OH moiety of pzet ligand exhibits a positional disorder between the non-bonding position and the bonding position with respect to the central copper ion along the Jahn-Teller axis. Hence, the structure of 1 can be considered to exhibit both 'square-planar' and 'octahedral' coordination geometries simultaneously for the copper ion in the same complex. A similar situation for the -OH groups has not been observed in the complexes 2 and 3 and hence the coordination geometry around the copper ion is axially elongated octahedron. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
