In this new method Schwarz Alternating method is used to find the complete complex stress functions for the stress field in two dimensional isotropic homogeneous infinite plate with a circular hole with uniform stretch shear stress applied at infinity. The first complex solution obtained with hole from complex stress functions and successive approximate solution obtained from boundary condition obtained at the circular boundary from the first solution. Addition of these two solutions will give the close form solution for the given problem. Stress concentration factors near the hole boundary and the stress field is same as that obtained by Krisch and Muskhelishvili earlier.</dc:description><dc:publisher>COUNCIL SCIENTIFIC INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-11T12:12:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:08:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-11T12:12:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:08:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>1993</dc:date><dc:type>Note</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDIAN JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY,31(7)539-541</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0019-5669</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/13486</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/958</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
