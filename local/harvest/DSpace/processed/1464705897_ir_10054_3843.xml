The complexes formed between GNI/GNA and amino acids were supported by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS). The structures of the complexes were optimized by computational studies using density functional theory, and stabilization energies were computed for the complexes to substantiate the interactions present between GNI/GNA and amino acid. The interactions were found to be primarily hydrogen bonding in nature. These interactions are reminiscent of those present in the lectin-carbohydrate and glycosidase substrate. Thus, the carbohydrate moiety present in GNI shows high specificity toward the -COOH group of the amino acid, which may be relevant to such interactions present between the carbohydrates and the polypeptides.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-14T03:05:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-14T03:05:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 72(9), 3430-3442</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-3263</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jo0700979</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/3843</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/3843</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
