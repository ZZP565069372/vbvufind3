The designs, both based on the rank-1 update scheme, can handle arbitrary matrix sizes, and are able to sustain their peak performance except during an initial latency period. Through these designs, the trade-offs involved in terms of local-memory and bandwidth for an FPGA implementation are demonstrated and an analysis is presented for the optimal choice of design parameters. The designs, implemented on a Virtex-5 SX240T FPGA, scale gracefully from I to 40 processing elements(PEs) with a less than 1% degradation in the design frequency of 373 MHz. With 40 PEs and a design speed of 373 MHz, a sustained performance of 29.8 GFLOPS is possible with a bandwidth requirement of 750 MB/s for design-II and 5.9 GB/s for dcsign-I.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE COMPUTER SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-25T04:33:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-25T04:33:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>22ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON VLSI DESIGN HELD JOINTLY WITH 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EMBEDDED SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS,341-346</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-0-7695-3506-7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1063-9667</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.13</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15603</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2071</dc:identifier><dc:source>22nd International Conference on VLSI Design held with 8th International Conference on Embedded Systems,New Delhi, INDIA,JAN 05-09, 2009</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
