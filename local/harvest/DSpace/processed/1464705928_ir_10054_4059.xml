Rapid synthesis of MnAPO-34 could be achieved using morpholine as the template that subsequently changes to MnAPO-20 during synthesis. The presence of manganese in the framework has been established by a number of experimental techniques. ESR spectra of the low manganese containing samples were better resolved, and by comparison of these with the ESR of Mn2+-exchanged samples, it was possible to conclude that Mn2+ was present in the framework of the MnSAPOs. The nature of the silicon site depended on the manganese content of the sample as seen from Si-29 MASNMR. With higher manganese content, more silica-rich regions next to SAPO domains in the framework were formed. In MnAPO-44, a complete ordering of the T atoms appeared to have been achieved with every P atom being surrounded by three Al and one Mn. DTA-TG, infrared, and UV-visible spectra of the samples will be discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-14T20:24:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-14T20:24:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY, 100(9), 3665-3670</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-3654</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp951800c</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4059</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4059</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
