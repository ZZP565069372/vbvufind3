Binding properties of L toward ten different biologically relevant Mn+ ions have been studied by fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy in methanol and aqueous methanol. L was found to detect Cu2+ selectively down to a concentration of 196 and 341 ppb, respectively, in methanol and 1:1 aqueous methanol even in the presence of other metal ions. The composition of the complex has been found to be 1:1 based on the Job plot and is further confirmed by ESI MS. The role of calix[4]arene platform as well as the pre-organized binding core in the selective recognition of Cu2+ has been demonstrated by studying appropriate reference molecules. The possible modes of binding of L with Cu2+ have been modeled by computational calculations. L and its Cu2+ complex could very well be differentiated based on the nano-structural features observed in SEM and AFM.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-10-06T03:56:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T15:40:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:05:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:51:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-10-06T03:56:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T15:40:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:05:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:51:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Tetrahedron Letters 50(23), 2735-2739</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0040-4039</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2009.03.109</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1691</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1691</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
