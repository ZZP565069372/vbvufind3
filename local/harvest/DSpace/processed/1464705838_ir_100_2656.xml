The as deposited films were annealed in air at 800 degrees C and slow cooled. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies were carried out on as deposited as well as on slow cooled film. Significantly larger defect concentration, including stacking faults, was observed in 50W as deposited films than the films deposited at a higher rf power of 200W. The film annealed at 800 degrees C and then slow cooled showed an unusual grain growth upto 180nm for a film thickness of similar to 240nm. These grains showed Kikuchi pattern.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CERAMIC SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T16:47:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T16:47:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FERRITES (ICF-9),165-169</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1-57498-218-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16065</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2656</dc:identifier><dc:source>9th International Conference on Ferrites (ICF-9),San Francisco, CA,AUG 22-27, 2004</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
