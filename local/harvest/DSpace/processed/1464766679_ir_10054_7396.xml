The X-ray diffraction results at room temperature show that the compound with x = 9 is predominantly martensitic whereas the one with x = 9.5 is austenite in nature. The maximum magnetic entropy change of 9.2 J kg(-1) K(-1) was achieved in x = 9.5 at 246 K in a field of 50 kOe and a value of 8.2J kg(-1) K(-1) was found near room temperature for x = 9. The effective refrigeration capacity of 106 J/kg has been calculated for x=9, which is larger than the same observed in other Ni-Mn based Heusler alloy systems. A large magnetoresistance of 25% was obtained around room temperature for x=9. The large difference in the magnetization between the martensitic and austenite phases is responsible for the large magnetocaloric effect and magnetoresistance in these compounds. .</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-28T12:09:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:50:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-28T12:09:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:50:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS, 499(2), 140-143</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0925-8388</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.03.190</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/7396</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/7396</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
