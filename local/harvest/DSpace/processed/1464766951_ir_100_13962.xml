However, the best fit points of the two sets differ from each other by about 10(-5) eV(2) in mass-square difference and by about 2A degrees in the mixing angle. Future solar neutrino and reactor anti-neutrino experiments are likely to reduce the uncertainties in these measurements. This, in turn, can lead to a signal for CPT violation in terms a non-zero difference between neutrino and anti-neutrino parameters. In this paper, we propose a CPT violating mass matrix which can give rise to the above differences in both mass-squared difference and mixing angle and study the constraints imposed by the data on the parameters of the mass matrix.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-06-26T05:24:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-06-26T05:24:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS,50(3)760-766</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0020-7748</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10773-010-0612-y</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/13962</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
