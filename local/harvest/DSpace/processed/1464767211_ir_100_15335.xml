The device efficiency and energy conversion efficiency in inverted devices were found to be 3.48% and 68%, respectively, whereas, in conventional devices these were 2.86% and 55%, respectively. This change of efficiency in inverted and conventional devices relates with the change of flat-band voltage extracted from Mott-Schottky capacitance study. The inverted device shows excellent efficiency even after 250 h in unencapsulated condition. However, the conventional device efficiency degrades very quickly compared with the inverted one. Thus, the films deposition order plays a pivotal role for fabricating a stable and high performance organic photovoltaic device. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
