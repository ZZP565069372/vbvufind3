The microstructural changes taking place in the milled powders (which eventually lead to mechanical alloying) are found to be retarded by SiC additions. High-resolution techniques such as electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and transmission electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (TEM/EDX) revealed the presence of localized. solute-rich regions long after the diffraction line from these solutes had ceased to appear in the X-ray diffractograms, Zinc appears to be more difficult to be mechanically alloyed into aluminum than either Cu or Mg in spite of its comparatively larger diffusivity in aluminum.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MINERALS METALS MATERIALS SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-18T19:30:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-18T19:30:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE, 27(11), 3718-3726</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1073-5623</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02595463</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10113</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10113</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
