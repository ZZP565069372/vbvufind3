Assessment of the risk of cyclone impacts requires a comprehensive characterization of historical cyclone climatology. This study analyzes the tracks of tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean. Based on their spatial characteristics, cyclone tracks appear to be grouped into five well-defined clusters. These clusters correspond to distinct regions of cyclonic activity and exhibit differences in characteristics such as genesis location, probability of landfall, duration, and maximum intensity. Some of the identified clusters appear particularly important with regard to impacts because events in these clusters have greater landfall probability and are more intense. The clustering approach is likely to provide useful insights for the characterization of cyclone risk.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T13:47:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T13:47:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>NATURAL HAZARDS, 68(2)645-656</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-013-0641-y</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15024</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
