Reheating of the same samples to 700 degrees C leads to alpha' -&gt; alpha(Zr) + beta(Zr) transformation following JMAK kinetics (n = 0.55 and k = 0.34). Tensile samples in annealed condition were deformed at 625-700 degrees C over strain rates of 2 x 10(-5)-1x10(-2) s(-1). With the increase in annealing time, strain rate sensitivity and activation energy for deformation were found to change from 0.42 to 0.20 and 181.4-685 kJ/mol respectively. The maximum peak stress (136.5 MPa) obtained at 700 degrees C from present results suggests higher load bearing ability of the Zr-2.5Nb alloy in annealed and quenched condition compared to that of cold-rolled and stress-relieved condition.
