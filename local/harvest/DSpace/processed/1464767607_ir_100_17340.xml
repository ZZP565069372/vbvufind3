In this study two types of biomass fuels were used viz., Biomethane and rice husk based syngas. Species present in these fuels were analyzed using gas chromatography. It showed that biomethane is composed of N-2 and CH4 whereas syngas comprised of CO2, H-2, N-2, CH4 and CO. During the performance study of the fuel cell, it was observed that syngas when used as fuel operated the cell at lower power density than that of biomethane. Thus an optimal combination of fuel and temperature can serve as a best power source for portable applications.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ESG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-29T06:45:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-29T06:45:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE, 9(12)8458-8464</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1452-3981</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17340</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
