The results generalize known formulas for the exponential distance matrix. When the number of variables are restricted to two, the bivariate analogue of the laplacian matrix of an arbitrary graph is defined. Also defined in this paper is a bivariate analogue of the Ihara-Selberg zeta function and its connection with the bivariate laplacian is shown. Finally, for connected graphs, there is a result connecting a partial derivative of the determinant of the bivariate laplacian and its number of spanning trees.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INT LINEAR ALGEBRA SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:07:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:07:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF LINEAR ALGEBRA, 23275-286</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/16026</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
