Optical data from IRS-1 satellite were also used for comparison with microwave data. Temporal ERS-1 SAR data acquired in three months (3 scenes) were also included in the analysis. The response of ERS-1 SAR data for soil moisture is better than that of JERS-1 SAR data. Effect of roughness and vegetation on soil moisture was observed in both the SAR data sets. The temporal changes in soil moisture using three ERS-1 SAR scenes were clearly seen. Classification accuracy of various land cover features are very poor in microwave data as compared to optical data.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-07-18T04:58:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T08:45:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:57:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-07-18T04:58:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T08:45:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:57:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Proceedings of the IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium 'Remote Sensing for a Sustainable Future' (V 1), Lincoln, Nebraska, USA, 27-31 May 1996, 163-165</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-3068-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1109/IGARSS.1996.516278</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1600</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1600</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
