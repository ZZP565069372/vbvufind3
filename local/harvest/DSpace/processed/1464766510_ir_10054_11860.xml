Seven of these were also structurally characterised by single crystal X-ray diffraction. All these complexes exhibit symmetric U2O2 core structures in addition to having a seven-co-ordinated environment about each uranium centre. Even when the ligand possessed more than one CH2OH group, only one such group was found to be involved both in chelation as well as in bridging. These complexes exhibited facile transmetallation reactions with vanadium and molybdenum precursors. Though their core structures are alike, the complexes differ in their lattice arrangement by exhibiting novel types of structures such as channel, herringbone and corrugated sheets owing to the presence of a number of extended weak interactions.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-28T22:30:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-28T22:30:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY-DALTON TRANSACTIONS, (7), 1213-1218</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0300-9246</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11860</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11860</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
