The road space is divided into a grid of equally sized cells. Moreover, each vehicle type occupies one or more cell as per its size unlike CA traffic flow model where each vehicle is represented by a single cell. Model needs inputs such as vehicle size, its maximum speed, acceleration, deceleration, probability constants, and arrival pattern. The position and speed of the vehicles are assumed to be discrete. The speed of each vehicle changes according to its interactions with other vehicles, following some stochastic rules depending on the circumstances. The model is calibrated and validated using real data and VISSIM. The results indicate that grid based model can reasonably well simulate complex heterogeneous traffic as well as offers higher computational efficiency needed for real time application.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INST TRANSPORTATION</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-03T10:40:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-03T10:40:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION, 42(4), 467-491</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0197-6729</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8992</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8992</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
