In comparison to multilegged robots, single-legged robots have only one type of locomotion gait, i.e., hopping, which represents a highly nonlinear dynamical behavior consisting of alternating flight and stance phases. Hopping motion has to be dynamically stabilized and presents challenging control problems. A large fraction of studies on legged robots has focused on modeling and control of single-legged hopping machines. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of developments in the field of single-legged hopping robots. We have attempted to cover development of prototype models as well as theoretical models of such hopping systems.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-14T11:54:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-14T11:54:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Review</dc:type><dc:identifier>ROBOTICA,25,587-613</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0263-5747</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0263574707003487</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/13914</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/3117</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
