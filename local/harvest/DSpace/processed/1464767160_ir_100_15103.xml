The implanted samples were subsequently treated by rapid thermal annealing at 750 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed improved grain formation for the implanted samples. However, a presence of microvoids was also observed in these samples; the amount of microvoids tended to increase on high-temperature annealing. Dominant donor-bound-exciton peaks is observed in all the samples along with some defect related to the exciton bound peaks although with a lesser intensity compared to as-deposited sample.
