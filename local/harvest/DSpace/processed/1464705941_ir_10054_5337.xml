Structural a nd electronic transport properties of the films deposited with different doping levels of fluorine (zero to 350 at %) were investigated. X-ray diffraction technique and Hall effect measurements were used for this work. Growth rate of the films was considerably affected by doping, specially at higher doping levels. The films were polycrystalline and preferentially oriented along [200]. This preferred growth played a dominant role in determining the transport properties. Notably the charge carrier mobility was directly governed by this preferred growth. The electrical conductivity was totally governed by the carrier concentration. The respective changes in carrier concentration were used to suggest the site selection of the fluorine dopant in the SnO2 lattice.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CHAPMAN HALL LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-19T15:02:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-19T15:02:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE, 31(11), 2965-2969</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-2461</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00356009</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5337</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5337</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
