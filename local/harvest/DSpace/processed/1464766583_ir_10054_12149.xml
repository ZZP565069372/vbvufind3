Though the deformation was immediately followed by quenching, the as-deformed samples contained recrystallized grains. A convention was adopted, based on grain size and in-grain misorientation developments, to distinguish between the deformed and recrystallized grains/orientations. At the highest deformation temperature(s), a clear pattern of increase (with increase in strain) in deformed cube {001} &lt; 100 &gt; was established. Such a pattern could not be explained from Taylor type deformation texture simulations, even after allowing nonoctahedral as well as octahedral slip. Microstructural observations could link, statistically, the increased cube presence with the presence of thicker deformed cube bands. The process of thickening was hypothesized as strain-induced boundary migration (SIBM) of the deformed cube bands into the adjacent noncube.
