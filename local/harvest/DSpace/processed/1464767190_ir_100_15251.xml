Here, the ability to capture the contact is brought about in a way different from Harten, Lax and van Leer with Contact (HLLC) scheme of Toro. In the present method, the flux vector of the Euler equations is split into convective and pressure parts before applying the HLL scheme to each part. Several carefully chosen one- and two-dimensional test problems are solved using the present method in order to demonstrate its robustness and efficacy. The new method is found to be free from problems like spurious expansion shock, carbuncle phenomenon, odd even decoupling, kinked Mach stem, which are usually faced by most of the contact resolving methods.
