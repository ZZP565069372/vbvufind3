The steroids studied include 6beta-bromocholest-4-en-3-one (3), 4,6beta-dibromocholest-1,4-dien-3-one (2), 2alpha,4,6beta-tribromocholest4-en-3-one (1), and (25R)-2alpha,6beta-dibromospirost-4-en-3-one (4). Steroids 1-4 were prepared by either acid-catalyzed or free-radical bromination from appropriate 4-en-3-one steroid. The study has yielded an insight into the factors responsible for conformational preferences of the A and B rings of these bromosubstituted steroids. Bromosubstitution at the 2a position is responsible for the inversion of the A ring to inverted 1beta,2alpha-halfchair conformation. The electronic interaction between 4-bromine and carbonyl oxygen distorts the A-ring conformation further. Inversion of the A ring has a concomitant effect of distortion in the chair form of the B ring. Conformational preferences of A and B rings are not found to be influenced by transmission effect of a side chain or oxygenated ring system.Temperature-dependent NMR studies indicate the reduced conformational flexibility of the A ring for 2alpha-bromosubstituted steroids. Complete assignment of the C-13 and H-1 resonances of two of the steroids studied (3 and 4) is presented.</dc:description><dc:publisher>BUTTERWORTH-HEINEMANN</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-19T06:57:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-19T06:57:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>1993</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>STEROIDS, 58(4), 170-177</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0039-128X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0039-128X(93)90064-T</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5204</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5204</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
