This paper reports the methodology of intelligent setup generation for prismatic parts machined on three axis CNC machining centers. A prototype system is developed which incorporates various algorithms for the generation, consolidation, minimization and sequencing of setups. The setup datums are determined and ordered considering the designed dimensional accuracy and stability of the part in the fixture. The system has been built as an application interface to the indigenously developed feature based part modeler which is capable of holding and representing the part features as well as designed interfeature relationships and associated tolerance information.</dc:description><dc:publisher>BEGELL HOUSE, INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T10:42:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T10:42:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>FLEXIBLE AUTOMATION AND INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING, 1998,545-557</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1-567-00118-1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16269</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2750</dc:identifier><dc:source>8th International Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing Conference,PORTLAND, OR,JUL 01-03, 1998</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
