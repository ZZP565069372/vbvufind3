Conformational changes occurred in DNA upon binding have been studied by circular dichroism. All these studies are suggestive that the metal complexes bind to DNA through intercalation. Binding of di-nuclear copper complex 5 was found to be stronger when compared to the other complexes studied. Copper complexes were found to cleave the plasmid DNA in the absence of oxidizing or reducing agent, whereas, zinc complexes do not cleave. Metal complexes have shown toxicity to the HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines. Morphological studies, western blot and FACS analysis are suggestive of apoptotic cell death induced by the metal complexes. Di-nuclear copper complexes were found to be better as compared to the mononuclear ones in binding, plasmid cleavage and also in causing more cell death.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T05:51:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T05:51:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL SCIENCES, 124(6)1217-1228</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12039-012-0319-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15383</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
