This paper reviews state-of-the-art approaches to ground motion characterization for these types of structures. Although considerable work is available on characterization of spatial variation of ground accelerations, no consistent design basis has yet evolved. A few studies have investigated spatial variation of ground displacements and differential displacements. Since research in this area is of relatively recent vintage, and not all aspects of the problem are well understood, it is currently most appropriate to use simple models for characterizing spatial variation of ground motion. This paper also highlights the possibilities for further investigations, particularly in the Indian context.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CURRENT SCIENCE ASSN</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-21T05:49:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-21T05:49:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>1994</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>CURRENT SCIENCE, 67(5), 386-394</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0011-3891</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5804</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5804</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
