The analysis here refers to plane frame, both steel and reinforced concrete (RC), modelled as a combination of series and parallel systems from the reliability standpoint. Using the concept of failure path probability, stochastically dominant failure modes are identified heuristically taking into account the infinite and limited rotation capacity of steel and RC sections. This paper highlights the advantage of using this strategy as it does away with the regeneration of failure modes for RC frames as has been attempted earlier. The heuristic also ensures that no failure mode with a reliability level that can be chosen during the analysis is missed, which contributes significantly to system failure probability.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCI LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-21T21:13:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-21T21:13:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>1992</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY, 37(1), 15-23</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0951-8320</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0951-8320(92)90053-N</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5996</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5996</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
