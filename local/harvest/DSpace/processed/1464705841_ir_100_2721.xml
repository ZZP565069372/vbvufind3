The time varying comb filters contained pre-calculated sets of coefficients, which were selected in steps, such that a cyclic sweeping of magnitude responses occur. Presently investigation has been carried out to find the best sweep cycle. The two sets of coefficients selected at any instant of time formed a pair of complementary comb filters with 18 auditory critical bands which provided spectral separation of components that are likely to get masked. Sweeping of bands provides temporal separation and reduces the effect of temporal masking. As the number of magnitude responses swept increases, the sweeping becomes smoother. The sweep cycle duration determines the time for which the sensory cells of the basilar membrane remain stimulated. Perception evaluation tests were conducted with slowly sweeping sine wave and running speech from a male and a female speaker for sweep cycles of 10, 20, 40, 50, 60, 80, and 100 ins. Best results were obtained for a sweep cycle of 50 ins.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T21:58:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T21:58:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>DSP 2002: 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1 AND 2,1145-1148</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-7503-3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16141</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2721</dc:identifier><dc:source>14th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP 2002),Santorini, GREECE,JUL 01-03, 2002</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
