The average coefficient of inbreeding was higher in Bangalore (F = 0.0339) than in Mysore (F = 0.0203), principally reflecting large-scale, post-Independence rural migration into Bangalore. Although there was some evidence of a decline in consanguineous marriages in Mysore, there was no convincing support in either city for earlier projections of a rapid reduction in the popularity of unions between close biological relatives.</dc:description><dc:publisher>GALTON FOUNDATION</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-29T21:02:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-29T21:02:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>1993</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE, 25(1), 111-116</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0021-9320</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/7831</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/7831</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
