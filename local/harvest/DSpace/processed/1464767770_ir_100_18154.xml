Apart from these events, the Iron Calorimeter can also detect other types of neutrino interactions, i.e. the electron neutrino charged current interactions and the neutral current events. It is possible to have a dataset containing mostly nu eCC events, by imposing appropriate selection cuts on the events. The nu mu CC and the neutral current events form the background to these events. This study uses Monte Carlo generated neutrino events, to design the necessary selection cuts to obtain a nu eCC rich dataset. An optimized set of constraints are developed which balance the need for improving the purity of the sample and having a large enough event sample. Depending on the constraints used, one can obtain a neutrino data sample with the purity of nu(e) events varying between 55% to 70%.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IOP PUBLISHING LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T08:22:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T08:22:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION, 10</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1748-0221</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/10/04/P04006</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/18154</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
