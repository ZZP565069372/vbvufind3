Anthocyanin extraction from fresh and dry grape waste was studied using various solvents. Six solvents were employed, and methanol with 0.1% (v/v) HCl provided the highest extraction of 1.18 x 10(-3) g.g(-1) for dry waste. The same solvent also exhibited the fastest kinetics and the shortest time (7 hours) required to attain equilibrium. The kinetics of extraction were well-described by a two-interface mass transfer model which considered the solvent diffusion effects on the mass transfer coefficients. equilibrium and hold-up studies were also carried out using the safest solvent for human consumption from among the solvents used for extraction.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MARCEL DEKKER INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-18T10:28:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-18T10:28:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>SEPARATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, 34(4), 683-697</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0149-6395</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1081/SS-100100674</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9978</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9978</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
