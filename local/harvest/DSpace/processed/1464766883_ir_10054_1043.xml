All ruthenium complexes were employed in the cyclopropanation reaction of styrene derivatives in the presence of diphenyldiazomethane. All complexes afford 1,1,3,3-tetraphenyl cyclobutane along with cyclopropane derivatives; complex, [CpRu(PPh2N(nBu)PPh2-κP,κP)(PPh3)]Cl shows better selectivity in the formation of 1,1,2-triphenylcyclopropane. In all reactions appreciable amounts of cyclopropanation products and metathesis products, 1,2-diphenylcyclopropane and 1,1-diphenylethene were obtained along with 1,1,3-triphenylpropene derivatives. The variable temperature NMR studies have suggested that the cyclopropanation reactions in the presence of ionic complex, [CpRu(PPh2N(R′)PPh2-κP,κP)(PPh3)]Cl proceeds via carbene intermediate, [CpRu(=CPh2)(PPh2N(R′)PPh2-κP)(PPh3)]Cl.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-03-20T06:00:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T19:57:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-03-20T06:00:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T19:57:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Journal of Organometallic Chemistry 688(1-2), 227-235</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-328X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jorganchem.2003.09.020</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1043</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1043</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
