It can be used to fabricate MEMS structures of high aspect ratio. However, the use of SU-8 in BioMEMS application has been limited by the fact that immobilization of biomolecules on SU-8 surfaces has not been reported. In this study, the epoxy groups on the SU-8 surface were hydrolyzed in the presence of sulphochromic solution. Following this, the surface was treated with [3-(2-aminoethyl) aminopropyl]-trimethoxysilane (AEAPS). The silanized SU-8 surface was used to incubate human immunoglobulin (HIgG). The immobilization of HIgG was proved by allowing FITC tagged goat anti-human IgG to react with HIgG. This process of antibody immobilization was used to immobilize HIgG on microfabricated SU-8 cantilevers.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-04-23T11:41:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-08T06:25:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:01:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-04-23T11:41:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-08T06:25:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:01:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Applied Surface Science 253(6), 3127-3132</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0169-4332</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1016/j.apsusc.2006.07.017</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1216</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1216</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
