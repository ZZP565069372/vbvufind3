Ethylene glycol employed in the synthesis plays a crucial role in restricting the particle size to nano dimensions. X-ray diffraction studies, Mossbauer spectroscopy and magnetic measurements suggest that as-prepared samples were small in size (similar to 15 nm) and hence display low saturation magnetization values (44-60 emu g(-1)). NixFe3O4 transforms into gamma-NiyFe2-yO3 and alpha-NiyFe2-yO3 after sintering at 720 and 1 020 K respectively as indicated by X-ray diffraction patterns. This was also confirmed by resistivity measurements. The electrical properties of the two transformed phases were comparable to their bulk values. It has also been found that a large substitution of Ni stabilizes gamma-phase at higher temperature.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CARL HANSER VERLAG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T12:50:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T12:50:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH, 104(7)680-685</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.3139/146.110909</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14931</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
