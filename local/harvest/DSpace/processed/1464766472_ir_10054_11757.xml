These ligands readily formed complexes with Group 6 metals and Ru-II, Ni-II, Pd-II and Pt-II. All complexes were characterised by elemental analysis, IF: and NMR spectroscopic methods of which P-31-{H-1} is most valuable. The structures of the bis(phosphine) ligand Ph2PN(CH2Ph)CH2CH2(CH2Ph)NPPh2 and its platinum(II) complex cis-[PtCl2{PPh2N(CH2Ph)CH2CH2(CH2Ph)NPPh2}] were determined by X-ray crystallography. The ligand crystallises in the extended conformation with both the nitrogen atoms nearly planar and the bond angles around them close to 120 degrees. The P-N distances are shorter than normally accepted P-N single bond lengths (ca. 1.77 Angstrom) suggesting some degree of P-N pi bonding. The seven-membered chelate ring in the platinum complex is non-planar but the metal atom is in a typical square planar environment with two phosphorus atoms and two chlorine atoms in a mutually cis disposition and the ethylenediamine bridge is folded with respect to the plane in an "open envelope" fashion.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-28T14:03:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-28T14:03:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY-DALTON TRANSACTIONS, (9), 1407-1412</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0300-9246</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/a809488h</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11757</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11757</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
