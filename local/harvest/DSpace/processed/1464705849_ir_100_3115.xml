Utilizing this strategy, total syntheses of five natural products YM-181741, (+)-ochromycinone, (+)-rubiginone B-2, (-)-tetrangomycin, and MM-47755 have been accomplished in 22%, 23%, 19%, 18%, and 12% overall yields, respectively. Our approach for the synthesis of these natural products having the benz[a]anthraquinone skeleton is based on a sequential intramolecular enyne metathesis, intermolecular Diels-Alder reaction (DAR), and aromatization. The intramolecular enyne metathesis reaction was employed for the synthesis of enantiopure 1,3-dienes in excellent yields. Furthermore, the synthesis of YM-181741 as well as structurally similar angucyclinones such as (+)-ochromycinone and (+)-rubiginone B-2 was achieved via asymmetric enolate alkylation of an oxazolidinone in excellent de. The related angucyclinones (-)-tetrangomycin and MM-47755, bearing a labile tertiary alcohol, were synthesized via Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation of a known allylic alcohol followed by opening the epoxide with Red-Al. The introduction of oxygen functionality at C-1 in all these natural products was accomplished by photooxygenation under a positive pressure of oxygen.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-15T06:26:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-15T06:26:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Review</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY,72(16)6116-6126</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-3263</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jo070709p</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/13936</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/3115</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
