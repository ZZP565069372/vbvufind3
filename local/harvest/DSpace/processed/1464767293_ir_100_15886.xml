A case study approach is used by analyzing the decision choices selected by five case companies that satisfy characteristics of line production system. The paper identifies decision choices specific to line shop as well as decisions that are influenced by non-process specific factors such as competitive priorities (order winner), strategic orientation of manufacturing (stages in H-W model), top management decisions, and size of the company. Findings on several decision choices are new to manufacturing literature. These research findings should be helpful to practitioners and researchers.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER LONDON LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T15:19:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T15:19:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY, 64(1-4)459-474</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00170-012-3991-9</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15886</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
