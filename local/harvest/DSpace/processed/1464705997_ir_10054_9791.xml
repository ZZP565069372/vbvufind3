The optical band gaps of CdS and doped CdS were found to be 2.35 and 2.39 eV, respectively. The carrier concentration of doped CdS, calculated from an optical method, was found to be 7.5 x 10(18) cm(-3). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that the films were polycrystalline and exhibited hexagonal structure. In order to calculate theoretical XRD intensity values for CdS, the structure factor right perpendicular F-(hkl) left perpendicular(2) was derived. The temperature correction factor was employed for both Cd and S to correct intensity values. The theoretically calculated XRD intensity values of (hkl) coincided with those of experimental values.
