The effect of ECAP on the hardness and tensile properties was studied. Microstructure predominately changed in the early part of the ECAP process and became equiaxed and uniformly distributed in both the longitudinal and the transverse sections after four passes. There occurred substantial softening over the first two passes—hardness of 10 Hv, yield strength of 14.2 MPa and tensile strength of 16.3 MPa in the as-cast condition decreased upon two passes to 6 Hv, 9.7 MPa and 13.0 MPa, respectively. The ductility (% elongation) increased drastically from &lt;50% in the as-cast condition to 150% upon two passes, and further increased to 230% after four passes. Various tensile properties and concurrent microstructural evolution were used to develop a mutual relationship among them.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-06-05T07:01:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-08T07:47:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:02:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-05T07:01:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-08T07:47:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:02:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Materials Science and Engineering: A  486(1-2), 341-349</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0921-5093</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1016/j.msea.2007.09.004</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1437</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1437</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
