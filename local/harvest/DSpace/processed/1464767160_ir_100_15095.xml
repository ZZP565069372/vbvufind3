The local effects of cracks on natural vibrations have been represented through the compliance approach in the modeling. The compliance coefficients in terms of crack orientation obtained through the concept of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) are employed. Solutions for free vibration problems are presented for both long and short beams. The analytical results are compared with FE results. The agreement is very good.</dc:description><dc:publisher>KRISHTEL EMAGING SOLUTIONS PVT LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T14:24:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T14:24:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ADVANCES IN VIBRATION ENGINEERING, 11(1)27-45</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15095</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
