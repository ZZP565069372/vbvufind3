Parametric analysis based on cyclic simulation model has been used as a design tool. This model begins with the estimates of the ideal refrigerating effect and ideal power requirement. Different losses in refrigerating effect and power are later incorporated to arrive at the net refrigeration effect and gross power requirements. Based on this information, the IPT cryocooler has been developed. A matching moving coil type opposed piston linear compressor has been designed and developed to meet the requirements of this IPT cryocooler. The system comprising IPT cryocooler and linear compressor has been installed and commissioned. To validate the design, detailed experimental investigations on the IPT are planned. Some of the experimental results are reported in this paper.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER INST PHYSICS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-23T09:23:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-23T09:23:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>ADVANCES IN CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING, VOLS. 49A AND B,710,1380-1387</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7354-0186-1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0094-243X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15087</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/1835</dc:identifier><dc:source>Joint Cryogenic Engineering Conference/International Cryogenic Materials Conference (CEC-ICMC),Anchorage, AK,SEP 22-26, 2003</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
