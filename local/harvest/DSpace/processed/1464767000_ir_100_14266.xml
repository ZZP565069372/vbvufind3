The reaction of the monotelluride dimethyl 5-tert-butyl-2-(butyltellanyl)isophthalate (6) with H(2)O(2) afforded the corresponding aryldiacyloxy-n-butyltellurane (8). The reaction of 6 with oxygen in the presence of moisture resulted in the formation of 8 as the major product along with traces of dimethyl 5-tert-butyl-2-(butyltellurinyl)isophthalate (7) and methyl 5-tert-butyl-3-oxo-3H-benzo[c][1,2]oxa tellurole-7-carboxylate (9). The telluroxide intermediate 7 readily undergoes a facile elimination reaction to give the elusive aryltellurenyl hydroxide, which is immediately trapped by the adjacent methyl ester functionality to give the cyclic tellurenate ester 9. Similarly, the hydrolysis of 7 with H(2)O affords the corresponding dihydroxytellurane 10, which is immediately converted to tellurane 8. Both compounds 8 and 9 have been characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallographic studies.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-06-26T09:10:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-06-26T09:10:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ORGANOMETALLICS,30(14)3892-3896</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0276-7333</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/om2001553</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14266</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
