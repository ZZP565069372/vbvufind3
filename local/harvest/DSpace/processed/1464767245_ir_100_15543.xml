The coatings were characterised using X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, TEM and electron microprobe analyser. Three distinct layers were seen in the optical micrographs in the coatings where deposition was carried out above the alpha-gamma transformation temperature. The smaller thickness of the top layer compared to that of the second layer has been attributed to the smaller diffusivity of Fe compared to Al in FeAl. The formation of the third layer has been rationalised based on the fact that at deposition temperatures &gt;1185 K, solid solution with Al above 1.5 at-% transforms to alpha with a definite boundary, while solid solution with less that 1.5 at-% Al will remain as gamma close to the substrate. Those deposited below this temperature will remain in alpha at all compositions, and no boundary is formed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MANEY PUBLISHING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T12:26:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T12:26:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, 29(3)357-363</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/1743284712Y.0000000105</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15543</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
