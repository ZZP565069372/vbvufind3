Further, these rocks have served as ideal host of varieties of economic minerals. The present work is an attempt to study the structurally deformed granulitic terrain in parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan in light of remote sensing, The study area falls under Sirohi, Banas Kantha and Sabar Kantha districts of Rajasthan and Gujarat. Remote sensing technique is utilized for the understanding of structural geology and deciphering the shear pattern. The methods adopted in this study include generation of false Color Composite (FCC) of satellite data, interpretation of lineaments from FCC and study the drainage pattern, structural basin delineation, profiling, and field mapping. It is observed that the area has undergone extensive deformation, There are two major sets of lineaments interpreted in the granulitic terrain such as WNW-ESE and NE-SW directions. Majority of the WNW-ESE lineaments are brittle in nature and N-S, NE-SW trending lineaments are ductile in nature. Overall the study area bifurcated into seven structural basins comprises of basic, granulites, calc granulites and pelitic granulites.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INDIAN SOCIETY  REMOTE SENSING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-02T16:33:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-02T16:33:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>PHOTONIRVACHAK-JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING, 34(4), 331-341</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0255-660X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8867</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8867</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
