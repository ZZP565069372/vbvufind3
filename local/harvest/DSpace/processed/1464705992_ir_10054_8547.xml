Since commercial preparation of 1,1-diphenylethane was not available, a structurally related compound, 1,1-diphenylethylene was chosen for the acclimatization of bacterial culture. More than 95% of 1,1-diphenylethylene (initial concentration 500 mg l(-1)) was degraded by naphthalene degrading Pseudomonas putida PaW 736 within six days. GS-MS analysis revealed the formation of benzophenone as the end-product with residual concentration of 157 mg l(-1) after six days of incubation. 1,1-diphenylethane was formed from the complete dechlorination of DDT using Mg degrees/Pd(+4) bimetallic system. P. putida PaW 736 acclimated to 1,1-diphenylethylene was also able to degrade 1,1-diphenylethane (initial concentration 250 mg l(-1)) using it as the sole source of carbon and energy. More than 80% degradation of 1,1-diphenylethane was observed following 5 days of incubation. However, any metabolites of the biodegradative pathway for the degradation of 1,1-diphenylethane could not be identified.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-01T21:11:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-01T21:11:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>CURRENT SCIENCE, 96(9), 1247-1251</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0011-3891</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8547</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8547</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
