Both ortho- and meta-trifluoromethylphenols exist in the syn conformer, which is the global minimum in both the cases. The IR spectrum in the O-H stretching region reveals the absence of an intramolecular O-H center dot center dot center dot F hydrogen bond in the syn-o-trifluoromethylphenol, which is in contrast to the results reported in the literature. The water complexes of both o-trifluoromethylphenol and m-trifluoromethylphenol are characterized by formation of O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds between the donor phenolic OH group and the acceptor water molecule. In addition, the o-trifluoromethylphenol-(water)(2) complex was also observed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T14:36:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T14:36:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A, 116(26)6996-7003</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp301208z</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15800</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
