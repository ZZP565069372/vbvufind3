Impact studies have been carried out on an instrumented drop weight impact test apparatus. Post-impact compressive strength has been obtained using NASA 1142 test fixture. Compressive strength of an unnotched specimen has been obtained using Lockheed test fixture with modified specimen geometry. Power fits for peak contact force and maximum plate displacement have been given as a function of plate thickness. It is observed that the impact damage area has quasi-lemniscate shape. Further, damage mechanism has been studied during the post-impact compressive testing. The residual compressive strength as a function of a plate thickness has been obtained.</dc:description><dc:publisher>VSP BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-09-01T09:53:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-09-01T09:53:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS, 12(4), 261-280</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0924-3046</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12742</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12742</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
