The compounds were separated by column chromatography on silica and isolated in 6-10 % yields. The compounds are characterized by HR-MS mass, NMR, absorption, electrochemical and fluorescence techniques. The meso-free 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY exhibit red shifted absorption and emission bands compared to meso-free BODIPY. The meso-free BODIPY exhibit green fluorescence and meso-free 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY exhibit orange fluorescence in solution. Furthermore, compared to meso-phenyl 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY, the meso-free 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY is more strongly fluorescent with nearly 41 % increase in quantum yield. Electrochemical studies showed that meso-free 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY exhibit one irreversible reduction and one ill-defined oxidation indicating that the compound is not stable under redox conditions. Computational studies revealed that meso-free pyrrolyl BODIPY has reduced HOMO-LUMO gap compared to parent meso-free BODIPY. Furthermore, the meso-free 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY exhibit much higher quantum yield compared to meso-aryl analogue of 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T17:21:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T17:21:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF FLUORESCENCE, 23(3)519-525</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10895-013-1165-2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15316</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
