The developed algorithm is verified by comparing solutions with analytical and finite difference results obtained for a simplified two dimensional transport problem. FEM results show a better agreement than FD solutions for higher Peclet number. The model is applied to study the ground water pollution due to the contamination from a proposed fly ash disposal pond. Spread of total dissolved solid concentration plume is investigated after a span of 25 years, since the pond becomes operative. Sensitivity of the dispersivity parameter on the TDS contours is also examined.</dc:description><dc:publisher>A A BALKEMA PUBLISHERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T09:40:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T09:40:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>FIRST INTERNATIONAL SPECIALIZED CONFERENCE ON WATER QUALITY AND ITS MANAGEMENT - PROCEEDINGS,549-557</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>90-5410-777-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16253</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2734</dc:identifier><dc:source>1st International Specialized Conference on Water Quality and Its Management,NEW DELHI, INDIA,MAR 02-06, 1998</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
