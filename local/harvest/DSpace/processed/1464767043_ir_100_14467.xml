Furthermore, the system is subjected to an external square wave potential. It was observed that different shapes (circular, elliptical, triangular, and multilobed stars) of the mercury drop could be stabilized as the frequency of the external potential and the volume of the mercury were varied. The redox potential time series for this forced MBH system, corresponding to the different stabilized topological configurations, were also recorded, and their power spectra were analyzed. The obtained results, involving the different topological modes, were fairly reproducible and sustainable. A possible oxidation-reduction mechanism for these experimental observations is provided.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-14T13:00:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-14T13:00:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A, 117(2)267-274</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp3095038</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14467</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
