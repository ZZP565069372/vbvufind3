The buildings, which are mostly non-engineered, have been classified based on the materials used for construction and their performance during the earthquake. The possible causes of damage, and the shortcomings in the prevalent construction practices have been clearly identified. On the basis of the analysis presented, it has been concluded that the performance of these buildings can be significantly improved through the use of simple earthquake-resistant features. The information presented herein may be useful in developing practical strategies for rehabilitating and retrofitting existing buildings in this region.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CURRENT SCIENCE ASSN</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-21T05:32:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-21T05:32:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>1994</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>CURRENT SCIENCE, 67(5), 380-385</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0011-3891</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5799</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5799</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
