The chemo sensing ensemble of Mg2+ bound L provides distinguishable features of response toward phosphates, viz., HPO42-, P2O74-, and AMP(2-) (Set A) and H2PO4-, ATP(2-), and ADP(2-) (Set B). While the Set A shows the formation of ternary complex, the Set B does not exhibit any intermediate complex, but both show the release of Mg2+ and L at different equivalents. The structures of {L + Mg2+} and its phosphate bound ternary complexes have been established by computational calculations, and the corresponding results agree well with the experimental ones. The microscopy studies show an aggregation-disaggregation phenomenon in the presence of different equivalents of phosphates in both of the sets. Using the fluorescence data, an INHIBIT logic gate has been built.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:01:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:01:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY, 87(18)9344-9351</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0003-2700</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1520-6882</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.5b02667</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17880</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
