MW power tracing, a post-facto analysis of power flow solution, is amenable to multiple solutions. This implies multiplicity of solution space of cost and loss allocation problem. Existing tracing methods enforce a 'proportionate sharing rule' to arrive at a solution. Case studies indicate that with such a sharing rule, extent of network usage predicted for large and distant loads can be much higher than the postage stamp or pro-rata allocation. To alleviate this problem, we suggest a new paradigm or MW power tracing algorithms wherein, we exploit the multiplicity of solution space so as to achieve a fair and equitable distribution of losses among the participants. We show that real power tracing represents a generic class of multi-commodity network flow problems and can be formulated as a linear constrained optimization problem. We propose a tracing compliant modified postage stamp allocation method which computes a traceable solution that minimizes deviation from the postage stamp allocation of losses. Results on practical data of central transmission utility of Western Regional Grid of India demonstrate the claims.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T15:41:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T15:41:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>2005 International Conference on Future Power Systems (FPS),450-455</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>90-78205-02-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16052</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2646</dc:identifier><dc:source>International Conference on Future Power Systems,Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS,NOV 16-18, 2005</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
