The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) is the most useful parameter to study the effect of climate change on glaciers. The ELA is a theoretical snowline at which the glacier mass balance is zero. Snowline altitude (SLA) at the end of melting season is generally regarded as the ELA. Glaciers of Chandra-Bhaga basin in Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh were chosen to study the ELA, using satellite images from 1980 to 2007. A total of 19 glaciers from the Chandra-Bhaga basin were identified and selected to carry out the study of ELA variation over 27 years. This study reveals that the mean SLA of the sub-basin has increased from 5009 +/- 61m to 5401 +/- 21m from 1980 to 2007. The study is in agreement with the reported increase in the temperature and decrease in winter snowfall of North-West Himalaya in the last century.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T13:34:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T13:34:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL, 28(4)311-322</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2012.705336</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15017</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
