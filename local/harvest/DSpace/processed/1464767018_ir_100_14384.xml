Mostly these works pertained to applications of ANN. Recently another tool of soft computing namely genetic programming (GP) has caught attention of researchers in civil engineering computing. This paper examines the usefulness of the GP based approach to predict the depth and geometry of the scour hole produced downstream of a common type of spillway, namely, the ski-jump bucket. Hydraulic model measurements were used to develop the GP models. The GP based estimations were found to be equally, and possibly more, accurate than the ANN based ones, especially when the underlying cause-effect relationship became more uncertain to model.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CESER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-07-17T10:23:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-07-17T10:23:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>International Journal of Tomography and Statistics,8( WO8)32-45</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0973-7294</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14384</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
