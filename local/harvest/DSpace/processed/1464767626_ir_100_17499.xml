Biotransformation of benzaldehyde and glucose by pyruvate decarboxylase produces (R)-PAC. This biotransformation suffers from toxicity of the substrate, product [(R)-PAC] and by-product (benzyl alcohol). In the present study, ionic liquid/aqueous biphasic system was employed to enhance (R)-PAC production. Fermented broth was the reaction medium in which Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 was the source of pyruvate decarboxylase. Hydrophobic ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM][PF6]) was the non-aqueous phase in which toxic compounds reside. Biocompatibility of [BMIM][PF6] and adequate distribution coefficients of benzaldehyde, (R)-PAC and benzyl alcohol were determined. A Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology were used for the optimization of biotransformation variables in order to maximize (R)-PAC yield and productivity. The results showed higher (R)-PAC yield and productivity of similar to 1.5-fold each in the biphasic biotransformation of phase volume ratio 0.05 as compared to the monophasic (conventional) biotransformation. Moreover, the level of major by-product benzyl alcohol was also 3.5-fold lower in biphasic biotransformation. [BMIM][PF6]/aqueous biphasic system is a new approach which could intensify the (R)PAC production.</dc:description><dc:publisher>HUMANA PRESS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-14T12:29:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-14T12:29:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY, 175(4)1771-1788</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0273-2289</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1559-0291</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-014-1394-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17499</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
