Looking at the projected widespread use of these materials, short life of stationary carbide tools and difficulties in the intermittent machining of these materials with PCD/CBN tools, the concept of rotary tool envisioned. Two force components viz. cutting and thrust were measured during the machining of Al/SiCp composites. Experiments were designed using Taguchi methods. Various factors and their interactions influencing the magnitude of forces were analyzed. Statistical models were proposed to estimate the magnitude of forces using the process, tool and work material dependent parameters. Magnitude of forces was found to be significantly influenced not only by the process and tool dependent parameters but also by the material dependent parameter.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MARCEL DEKKER INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-18T13:07:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-18T13:07:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, 13(1), 65-84</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1042-6914</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10426919808935220</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10026</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10026</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
