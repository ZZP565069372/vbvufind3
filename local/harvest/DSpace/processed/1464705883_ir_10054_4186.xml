Our aftershock locations show a trend that dips toward the south at about 50 which is interpreted as the fault plane of the mainshock. The depth range of the aftershocks is from 10 to 35 km, which is somewhat deeper than other crustal earthquakes, and indicates that the faulting did not reach the surface. The area of the fault is about 40x40 km(2), which is small for a Mw7.7 earthquake and results in a high static stress drop of 13 to 25 MPa. There are no mapped faults or obvious topographic features along the surface projection of this fault. These findings show that very large damaging earthquakes can occur without producing surface faulting, which is an important issue for earthquake hazard assessments in continental regions.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-15T07:22:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-15T07:22:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, 29(20), -</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0094-8276</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2002GL015280</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4186</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4186</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
