Shifting these HOMs to avoid the resonance is a topic of active interest. A study has been carried out for the accelerating cavities of the INDUS-2. For quantitative measure of deciding which modes have to be moved and by how much, we introduce a new index called the matching index (I-M), as a measure of how close a HOM is to the nearest beam mode. Depending on the value of IM, the operating scenarios are classified as safe and unsafe.
