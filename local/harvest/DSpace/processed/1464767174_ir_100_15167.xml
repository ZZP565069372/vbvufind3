The changes in bond lengths, atomic charges, natural bond order and aromaticity in the S-0, S-1 and S-2 states have been analysed. The electronic state dependence of the hydrogen bonding strengths at different H-bonding sites of PACO has been looked into. The hydrogen bonds formed through the H-bond accepting carbonyl moiety in PACO. 3H(2)O cluster appears to get weaker in the excited states while that formed through the H-bond donating amino moiety gets much stronger, compared to their ground state counterpart. The simultaneous strengthening of H-bonds at one site and weakening at another in the S1 and S2 states may have link to the overall stabilization of the clusters in the excited states relative to the ground state as observed experimentally.
