Condensation of 1 equiv of thiophene monocarbinol with 1 equiv of substituted aldehyde and 1.5 equiv of pyrrole under refluxing propionic acid conditions followed by alumina column chromatographic purification yielded the desired 22-thiacorroles. Although the corrole formation had been observed with variety of substituted aldehydes, the stable thiacorroles were isolated in 2-3% yields only with 4- and 3-nitrobenzaldehydes. The stable thiacorroles were obtained only under harsh propionic acid conditions and any other mild reaction conditions did not yield 22-thiacorroles. The structure of thiacorroles were unambiguously established using mass, and ID and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The NMR study indicated diminished ring current and distortion of 22-thiacorroles. DFT studies also supported the distortion of thiacorroles. The absorption spectra showed reduction in number of absorption bands and fluorescence study indicated that 22-thiacorroles are weakly fluorescent. The electrochemical studies indicated that 22-thiacorroles undergo easier reductions compared to thiaporphyrins.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-15T00:13:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-15T00:13:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 75(12), 4172-4182</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-3263</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jo100607t</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4102</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4102</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
