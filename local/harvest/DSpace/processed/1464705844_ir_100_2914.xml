The weighted resistor sub-family has been studied in the recent past. This paper presents a detailed study of the sub-family of ladder DACs. Some DACs have one or more interesting features, such as, minimum number of resistors, minimum spread minimum total resistance, all equal-valued resistors. Ir is interesting to note that the R-2R ladder DAC when realized,vith all equal valued resistors not only has the least possible spread but also has the minimum total resistance. Also there is another DAC which has the same spread of 2 as R-2R ladder DAC brit requires the minimum number of resistors.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T21:32:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T21:32:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>IMTC/99: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 16TH IEEE INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE, VOLS. 1-3,515-520</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-5277-7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1091-5281</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16422</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2914</dc:identifier><dc:source>16th IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference,VENICE, ITALY,MAY 24-26, 1999</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
