The John-Wilkins-Lee equation of state has been used to calculate the pressure caused by the release of the chemical energy of the explosive. Detonation point from center of hole has been defined for the traveling path of explosive energy. Elastoplastic dynamic failure constitutive with kinematic hardening model was adopted for rock mass responses under high explosive pressure to understand the mechanism of blast phenomena. In this model, it is assumed that failure of rock occurs under tensile failure when yield plastic stress exceeded to its static tensile strength. The hydrostatic pressure was used as a failure measure to model dynamic spall or a pressure cut off. Variation of detonation velocity has been measured in terms of simulation blast output energies index results.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER HEIDELBERG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T10:19:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T10:19:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES, 6(10)3703-3708</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-012-0632-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14728</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
