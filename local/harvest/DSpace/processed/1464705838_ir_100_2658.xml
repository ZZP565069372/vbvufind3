The as deposited films were annealed in air and either quenched or slow cooled. Magnetization studies were carried out on the as deposited as well as annealed films using a SQUID magnetometer. The M-H curves were measured up to a field of 7T, at temperatures varying from 5K to 300K. The magnetization in the films did not saturate, even at the highest field. The expression, M(H)= Q(1- a /H(n)) fitted the approach to saturation best with n=:1/2, for all films and at all temperatures. The coefficient a was the highest for the as deposited film and was the smallest for the quenched film. In the case of as deposited film, the value of coefficient a increased with increasing temperature, while for the annealed films, the value of a showed a decrease as temperature increases.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CERAMIC SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T17:04:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T17:04:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FERRITES (ICF-9),201-205</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1-57498-218-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16068</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2658</dc:identifier><dc:source>9th International Conference on Ferrites (ICF-9),San Francisco, CA,AUG 22-27, 2004</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
