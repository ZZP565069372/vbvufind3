While, a detailed analysis of application of rotary tools in turning operations has been done, their application in the generation of plain surfaces has received limited attention. This paper deals with the modeling of cutting forces in a face-milling operation performed using self-propelling inserts. The proposed model incorporates differences in the machining mechanics of self-propelling inserts due to the difference in their geometry and rotation in a static force prediction model in a face-milling operation with stationary inserts. The predicted values Of Cutting forces evaluated by the proposed model are in excellent agreement with the experimental value than those predicted using the static force model as it is.
