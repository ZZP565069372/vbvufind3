One way to achieve this is by direct bandpass sampling of the desired RF signal band to base-band frequency. However, the design of a software radio receiver becomes more complicated when two or more distinct RF signals are to be received. The traditional approach for this case has been to bandpass sample a continuous span of spectrum containing all the desired RF signals. The disadvantage with this approach is that the required sampling rate depends upon the span of spectrum. instead of the information bandwidths of the signals. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to compute the minimum bandpass sampling frequency for direct downconversion of multiple distinct RF signal bands simultaneously. The novelty of this algorithm is that, at each iteration, it not only checks for a valid sampling frequency. but also determines the next possible minimum value of sampling frequency.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T15:27:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T15:27:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>2005 IEEE/SP 13th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing (SSP), Vols 1 and 2,295-300</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-9403-8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16049</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2644</dc:identifier><dc:source>13th IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing,Bordeaux, FRANCE,JUL 17-20, 2005</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
