Region growing algorithm coupled with path following approach was used for phase unwrapping. Phase to height conversion was done using D-GPS control points. Geocoding was done using GAMMA software. A sample data of DEM of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) of the Bhuj area is made available by DLR Germany. The intensity image, DEM and Error map are well registered. The spatial resolution of this DEM is about 25 m with height accuracy of a few meters. The DEM derived through ERS SAR data is prone to atmospheric affects as the required two images are acquired in different timings where as SRTM acquired the two images simultaneously. An RMS height error of 12.06 m is observed with reference to SRTM though some of the individual locations differ by as much as 35 m.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INDIAN SOC REMOTE SENSING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-02T16:22:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-02T16:22:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>PHOTONIRVACHAK-JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING, 33(2), 267-276</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0255-660X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8865</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8865</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
