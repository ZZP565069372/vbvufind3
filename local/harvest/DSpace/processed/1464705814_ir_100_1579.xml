The phasicity is believed to depend upon the syncytial properties of the smooth muscle cells, We have investigated the effects of 1- heptanol, an intercellular uncoupling agent, on the phasicity of EJCs. In control Krebs solution EJCs with a positive phase (p- and b-EJCs) occurred as a considerable fraction of total EJCs recorded, Following the application of 2 mM heptanol for 2-3 min., the occurrence of p- and b-EJCs decreased markedly while that of n-EJCs increased. The change was reversible and repeatable. Heptanol did not, however, affect the prejunctional nerve action potential. These bioelectric results can be explained in terms of the specific uncoupling of smooth muscle cells by heptanol.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-22T02:02:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-22T02:02:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>PROCEEDINGS OF THE 18TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOL 18, PTS 1-5,18,1769-1770</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-3812-X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/14790</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/1579</dc:identifier><dc:source>18th Annual International Conference of IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-amd-Biology-Society,AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS,OCT 31-NOV 03, 1996</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
