Phosphine ethers react with Group 6 metal carbonyls to form complexes of the type [M(CO)4L2] and [M(CO)5L] (M = Mo, Cr, W). The reaction of Ph2PC6H4OCH2OCH3-o with RuCl3Â· 3H2O gave ruthenium(III) complex, [Ru(Ph2PC6H4O-o)3] through the elimination of CH3OCH2Cl whereas the reaction with CpRu(PPh3)2Cl resulted in the formation of [CpRu(Ph2PC6H4O-o)PPh3]. Treatment of Ph2PC6H4OCH2OCH3-o with rhodium(I) derivatives resulted in the formation of complexes with the phosphine exhibiting both mono- and bidentate modes of coordination involving the phosphorus center and the phenolic oxygen. The reaction of Ph2PC6H4OCH2OCH3-o with [PdCl2(COD)] led to the isolation of two mononuclear complexes, [PdCl(Ph2PC6H4O-o)(Ph2PC6H4OH-o)] cocrystallized with phosphonium salt, [Ph2P(CH2OCH3)C6H4OH-o]Cl and [Pd(Ph2PC6H4O-o)2] as confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies. The former shows extensive hydrogen bonding interactions between the complex and the phosphonium salt. The metalloligand, Cp2Zr(OC6H4PPh2-o)2 obtained by the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with Ph2PC6H4OH-o form heterobimetallic complexes with Mo(0), Re(I) and Ni(0) carbonyl derivatives. The reactions of Cp2Zr(OC6H4PPh2-o)2 with metal halides such as M(COD)Cl2 (M = Pd, Pt) and CpRuCl(PPh3)2 afforded metallacycles, [M(Ph2PC6H4O-o)2] and [CpRu(PPh2C6H4OH-o)(PPh2C6H4O-o)], respectively via transmetallation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-03-20T06:00:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T19:58:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-03-20T06:00:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T19:58:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Journal of Organometallic Chemistry 689(21), 3335-3349</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-328X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jorganchem.2004.07.041</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1045</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1045</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
