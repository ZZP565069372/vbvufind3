The gas flow was assigned and described by the Poiseuille-flow velocity profile. Rotating and oscillating flame patterns in a radial channel were observed only within certain ranges of gas flow rates. Formation of these special flame structures is related to preheating of unburned mixture by hot walls and non-uniform velocity distribution inside the microchannel. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute.
