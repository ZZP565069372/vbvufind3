The grading involves magnetization with the use of nickel zinc ferrite of composition Ni0.7Zn0.3Fe2O4 (NZFO) and pure Ni. In homogeneous bilayers of PZT-Ni or PZT-NZFO, the ME voltage coefficient (MEVC) vs H data do not show any hysteresis or remanence. Upon grading the ferromagnetic layer, significant changes including hysteresis and remanece are observed. In PZT-Ni-NZFO, MEVC vs H data show a positive remnant MEVC and a negative coercive field. When the grading is reversed, in samples of PZT-NZFO-Ni, the remnant MEVC is negative and the coercive field is positive. A theory is proposed for the low-frequency ME effects in the graded composites. According to the model, the grading in the magnetization leads to a built-in magnetic field in the ferromagnetic layer, and this field depends on the sequence of grading and the thickness of the NZFO and Ni layers. As a result, the total torque moment and flexural deformations in the composite and the bias field dependence of ME voltage coefficient becomes strongly hysteretic. Calculated MEVC vs H, remnant MEVC, and coercive field are in good agreement with the data.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER PHYSICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T17:21:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T17:21:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>PHYSICAL REVIEW B, 85(10)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.85.104404</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15315</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
