The reacting system is a combination of various series and parallel reactions. In the present work, the reaction is studied using a cation exchange resin (Amberlyst 15®) as catalyst. The effect of catalyst loading and temperature on reaction kinetics was evaluated and three models based on simplified Langmuir–Hinselwood mechanism are proposed. Aim of the work is to minimize undesired side-products and understand the effect of different parameters and operating modes on DAA:MO product ratio in reactive distillation (RD). It has been shown that the reaction when operated in a reactive rectification mode offers flexibility in the relative production rates of DAA and MO. The experimental results obtained are explained by simulation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-02-18T05:29:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T17:09:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:05:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:53:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-02-18T05:29:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T17:09:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:05:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:53:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Chemical Engineering Science 62(18-20), 5567-5574</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0009-2509</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2007.01.045</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/686</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/686</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
