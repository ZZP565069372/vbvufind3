Accordingly they constitute a serious public health hazard and are of sufficient environmental concern. We have earlier reported that both MY and MG have tumor promoting effects on the development of hepatic preneoplastic lesions induced by N-nitrosodielhylamine in rats. In order to understand the possible mechanism(s) by which metanil yellow (MY) and malachite green (MG) promotes liver tumor development, we have studied the tyrosine phosphorylation and protein phosphatases during tumor promotion. We have also investigated the possible overexpression of G1/S cyclins and PCNA during tumor promotion by MY and MG. The present investigation indicates that enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation is associated with no change in levers of tyrosine protein phosphatases. We have also observed an increase in the expression of PCNA and G1/S cyclins during tumor promotion. These factors collectively may contribute to the abnormal cell proliferation during tumor promotion by MY and MG.
