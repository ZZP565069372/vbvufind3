The single crystal X-ray structure of L-2 has been established. All these derivatives have been studied for metal ion recognition by fluorescence and absorption techniques. Among these, L-6 and L-7 were found to be selective towards Cu2+ even in the presence of other metal ions in aqueous acetonitrile owing to the presence of the N,O-binding core up to the lowest concentration of 210 +/- 11 and 144 +/- 3 ppb, respectively. The binding region has been identified by H-1 NMR studies. The proposed mode of binding has been modelled by DFT computations.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:23:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:23:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY, 36(11)2397-2404</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2nj40409e</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/16057</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
