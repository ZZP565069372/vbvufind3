Thermal and electrical resistivities of soils are of great importance in view of the subsurface transmission of high power currents wherein it is essential to estimate the resistance offered by the soil in dissipating the heat generated due to transmission of the current. Realising this an effort has been made in this paper to develop a generalised relationship, which can be used, particularly by practising engineers, to estimate either soil electrical resistivity or soil thermal resistivity if one of the two is known. Such a relationship would also be helpful in estimating some fundamental soil properties (viz. unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity, liquefaction potential, moisture content) as enunciated by other researchers.
