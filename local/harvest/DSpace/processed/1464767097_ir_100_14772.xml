The films were studied after ex-situ annealing for 2 h in air at various temperatures up to 650 degrees C. The magnetic properties of the bilayers were studied at 300 K and at 10 K. Ferromagnetic resonance was carried out at x-band frequencies at room temperature. It was found that as a result of annealing, the diffusion between Co ferrite and Zn ferrite starts around 350 degrees C and leads to a large line width system having magnetization, which remains undetected by Ferromagnetic resonance.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T10:41:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T10:41:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS, 49(7)4200-4203</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2013.2251327</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14772</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
