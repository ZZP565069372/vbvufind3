Glass transition temperature (T (g) = 296 A degrees C) and crystallization temperatures (T (C1,2)) were obtained from thermal analysis. LATP glass was converted to glass-ceramic by heat treatment in the range 550-950 A degrees C for 6 h. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed LiTi2(PO4)(3) as a major phase. Ionic conductivity increased monotonically with concentration, reaching a maximum of similar to 10(-4) S/cm. AlPO4 phase was detected in samples heat-treated above 850 A degrees C. Its presence decreased the conductivity, suggesting LiTi2(PO4)(3) phase as main contributor to high ionic conductivity. NMR spectra confirmed the presence of mobile Li-7 ions in the entire sample series and also gave some information on the structure and dynamics of conductivity.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-14T17:41:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-14T17:41:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY, 16(5)1761-1766</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10008-011-1592-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14594</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
