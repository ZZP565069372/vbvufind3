Mild steel was coated with a composite layer of nickel and chromium using the plasma technique. This was followed by laser irradiation using a continuous carbon dioxide laser. Oxidation and corrosion behaviour of these alloys was then determined by carrying out oxidation in air at 800 degrees C and corrosion tests at room temperatures in 1 N H2SO4 With a 75 mu m layer of nickel and chromium each, it was possible to make surface alloys on mild steel, which had a chromium concentration of 6-7 wt%, but the nickel concentration varied from 10-20 wt%. Oxidation behaviour improved significantly over the as-coated specimen and aqueous corrosion improved considerably.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T16:26:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T16:26:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>1995</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE, 30(18), 4684-4691</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-2461</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01153079</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12133</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12133</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
