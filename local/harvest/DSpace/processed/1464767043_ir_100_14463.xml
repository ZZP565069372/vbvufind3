The protofilaments are composed of longitudinally attached tubulin dimers that can exist in either a less curved state [GTP-bound tubulin (T)] or a more curved state [GDP-bound tubulin (D)]. Hydrolysis of T into D leaves the straight and laterally attached protofilaments of the microtubule in a mechanically stressed state, thus leading to their unzipping. The elastic energy in the unzipping protofilaments can be harnessed by a force transducer such as the Dam1-kinetochore ring complex in order to exert pulling force on chromosomes during cell division. In the present paper we develop a simple continuum model to obtain this pulling force as a function of the mechanical properties of protofilaments and the size of the Dam1-kinetochore ring. We also extend this model to investigate the role played by the T subunits found at the plus end of the microtubule (the T cap) on the mechanical stability of microtubules.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER PHYSICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-14T12:58:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-14T12:58:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>PHYSICAL REVIEW E, 88(6)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1539-3755</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1550-2376</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.88.062708</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14463</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
