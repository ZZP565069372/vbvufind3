Detailed two-component laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) based measurements have been undertaken in regions close to the suction strip and further downstream. The region close to the strip involves a flow reversal accompanied by a change in sign for the Reynolds shear stress and strong gradients in the flow variables. The mean streamwise velocity after suction remains larger than its corresponding no-suction value. Relative to the no-suction case, the velocity fluctuations first decrease with suction followed by a slow recovery which may involve a slight overshoot. LIF visualizations indicate that compared to the no-suction case, the low-speeds streaks stay closer to the wall and exhibit a smaller amount of spanwise and wall-normal oscillations with suction. The visualization results are consistent with two-point velocity correlation measurements. The streamwise and spanwise correlation measurements indicate that the structures are disrupted or removed from the boundary layer due to suction suggesting that the original boundary layer has been strongly influenced by suction. The results are explained by the development of a new inner layer that forms downstream of the suction strip.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T15:54:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T15:54:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS, 48(5), 747-762</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0723-4864</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00348-009-0766-7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12126</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12126</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
