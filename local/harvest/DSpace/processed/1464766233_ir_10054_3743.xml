Their spirocyclic anions were trapped with MeI, giving the spirocyclic complexes (CO)(8)(mu-PCy2)Re-2(mu(4)-E)Fe-2(mu-EMe)(CO)(6) (E = S (3a), Se (3b), Te (3c)). Their molecular structures were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. The anions of 2a-c are sensitive to oxidation. On crystallization in the presence of oxygen the corresponding dichalcogenides [(CO)(8)(mu-PCy2)Re-2(mu(4)-E)Fe-2(CO)(6)](2)(mu(4)-E-2) (E = S (4a), Se (4b), Te (4c)) were obtained in good yield. Their molecular structures were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. 2a was also trapped with CF3COOH, giving (CO)(8)(mu-PCy2)Re-2(mu-S-4)Fe-2(mu-SH)(CO)(6) (5). The latter can be expanded by SH oxidative addition of its mu-SH function to Os-3(CO)(11)(NCMe), giving the mixed-metal carbonyl complex (CO)(8)(mu-PCy2)Re-2(mu(4)-S)Fe-2(CO)(6)(mu(3)-S)Os-3(mu-H)(CO)(11) (6). The framework of 6 could be derived from X-ray diffraction data. However, these data were insufficient for complete solution of the molecular structure, but spectroscopic data and elemental analysis of 6 are in accordance with the proposed molecular structure.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-13T18:36:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-13T18:36:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ORGANOMETALLICS, 22(17), 3360-3366</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0276-7333</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/om030200u</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/3743</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/3743</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
