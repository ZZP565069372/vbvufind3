The purpose of this paper is to show the different techniques developed by various researchers in the analysis of tube sheets. A thorough literature review is undertaken and the different techniques such as analytical, experimental and numerical are dealt with separately. Finally the results obtained by various research workers are compared and the authors' work is also mentioned. The future scope in this field as proposed by the authors is also discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCI LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-15T09:51:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-15T09:51:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Review</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSELS AND PIPING,67(3)279-297</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0308-0161</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0308-0161(95)00026-7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/13975</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/3167</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
