Whole-rock samples from the Shyok volcanics yielded disturbed age-spectra and we have demonstrated earlier that the youngest tectonic event in the Shyok suture zone responsible for the thermal disturbance of these samples is Karakoram fault activation at not, vert, similar14 Ma. Contrastingly whole-rock samples from the Khardung volcanics, which are in tectonic contact with these Shyok volcanics, and are exposed in the form of thick rhyolitic and ignimbritic flows, yielded undisturbed age-spectra and good plateau-ages. The whole-rock plateau-ages of two rhyolite samples are 52.8 ± 0.9 and 56.4 ± 0.4 Ma. We interpret these ages to be the time and duration of emplacement of these volcanics over thickened margin of the continental crust, which appears to be coeval with the initiation of the collision between the Indian and Asian plate. The lesser extent of post-emplacement isotopic re-equilibration in these samples unlike the Shyok volcanics indicate that these samples were present in different tectonic settings, away from the Karakoram fault, at the time of deformation in the Shyok suture zone. We propose that the two volcanic belts of contrasting nature were brought together in juxtaposition by the Karakoram strike slip faulting at not, vert, similar14 Ma.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-06-25T11:09:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T15:02:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:04:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:50:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-25T11:09:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T15:02:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:04:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:50:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Journal of Asian Earth Sciences  34(2), 168-177</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1367-9120</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2008.03.013</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1574</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1574</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
