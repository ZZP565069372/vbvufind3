This is a rapid tracking algorithm that uses the fact that the value of "beta," an intermediate variable, especially defined for the purpose, remains constant (=beta(MPP)) for a given WEGS at the MPP irrespective of the wind velocity. The value of beta(MPP) is known in advance. The algorithm works in two stages. In the first stage, it uses large steps to quickly drive the operating point to lie within a narrow band with limits beta(max) and beta(min). In the second stage, exact MPP is tracked using the " perturb and observe" method. No extra hardware or measurements (sensors) are required compared to the existing algorithms. Hence, the cost is not increased. Application of the proposed algorithm to an example WEGS shows that the time taken by the system to reach MPP is much smaller compared to most of the existing algorithms. A prototype matrix converter has been developed for grid interfacing and the proposed MPPT scheme has been implemented in conjunction with Venturini and space-vector-modulation-based switching schemes. All the results of this study are presented.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-31T18:28:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:40:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-31T18:28:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:40:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION, 25(1), 228-236</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0885-8969</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2009.2032613</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8197</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8197</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
