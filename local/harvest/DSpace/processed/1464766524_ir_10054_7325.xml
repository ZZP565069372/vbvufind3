The nano-Fe(2)O(3) based composite coatings were applied on mild steel substrate by dipping. The dispersion of nano-Fe(2)O(3) particles in coating system was investigated by SEM and AFM techniques. The effect of addition of these nano-pigments on the electrochemical behavior of the coating was investigated in 3.5% NaCl solution, using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Coating modified with higher concentration of nano-Fe(2)O(3) particles showed comparatively better performance as it was evident from R(po) and C(c) values after 30 days of exposure. In general, the study showed an improvement in the corrosion resistance of the nano-particle modified coatings as compared to the neat coating, confirming the positive effect of nano-particle addition in coatings.
