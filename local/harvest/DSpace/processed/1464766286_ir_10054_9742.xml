Various startegies have been applied to improve the growth rate and diacetyl yield. The use of multiple substrates affected growth as well as the yield of diacetyl. Growth on a medium containing glucose demonstrated a diauxic growth profile, with the second phase of growth being on the product, lactic acid. L. rhamnosus also grew on a medium containing citrate. Growth on medium containing glucose+citrate demonstrated simultaneous utilization of carbon sources. L. rhamnosus did not grow in a medium containing acetate and also did not co-metabolize it with glucose. Maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)) was found to increase in the case of simultaneous utilization of glucose+citrate (0.38 h(-1)) as compared to glucose as the sole carbon source (0.28 h(-1)). The yields of diacetyl were also found to increase for glucose+pyruvate and glucose+citrate (0.10 and 0.05 g g(-1) of glucose, respectively) as compared to glucose alone (0.01 g g(-1) of glucose). The productivity of diacetyl on medium containing glucose and citrate was double that of a medium containing only citrate, although the yields were comparable.</dc:description><dc:publisher>KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-17T04:20:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:44:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-17T04:20:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:44:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY &amp; BIOTECHNOLOGY, 19(5), 509-514</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0959-3993</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1025170630905</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9742</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9742</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
