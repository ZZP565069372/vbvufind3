The magnetic properties of the bilayers and of the single layer films deposited in identical conditions were studied at 300 K and at 10 K. Magnetic properties of the bilayers, in general, were found to be in between the individual values of the single layers. Magnetic measurements at 10 K clearly showed a two stepped magnetic hysteresis loop corresponding to the switching of the magnetic moments of the soft ZnFe2O4 and the hard CoFe2O4 layers. A study was also carried out by changing the thickness of ZnFe2O4 layer in the bilayer. This study showed that the magnetic properties of the bilayers even at room temperature can be controlled to some extent by changing the thickness of the soft ZnFe2O4 layer while maintaining a low substrate temperature of 350 A degrees C.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T10:45:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T10:45:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND NOVEL MAGNETISM, 25(8)2653-2657</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10948-011-1237-y</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14779</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
