In general, there is no single set of views that can capture all requirements. Since the quality attributes such as cost, schedule, security etc. have very high business value, the architecture of the system needs to be evaluated to determine whether it has achieved the quality attributes as specified in the requirements. As part of a semester-long course, we implemented ArchKriti - A Software Architecture Based Design and Evaluation Tool Suite. This tool attempts to support the following crucial steps in architecture-based software development - Quality Attribute brainstorming, attribute-driven design (ADD), architecture evaluation and documentation. Our openended design facilitates the addition of new architectural styles and views. We discuss the design issues and implementation of this tool suite and briefly mention our experiences managing this project.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE COMPUTER SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T06:44:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T06:44:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>International Conference on Information Technology, Proceedings,701-706</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-0-7695-2776-5</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15937</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2425</dc:identifier><dc:source>4th International Conference on Information Technology - New Generations,Las Vegas, NV,APR 02-04, 2007</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
