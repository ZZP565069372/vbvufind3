Though such schemes are able to damp the SSR modes for small disturbances, they are unable to damp transient SSR due to large disturbances. In this report, an improvement in the control aspect of the SVC at the midpoint of the power transmission line is suggested. This scheme attempts different auxiliary signals that include line current, computed internal frequency and bus angle deviations. A system of configuration similar to IEEE First Bench Mark model is considered, eigenvalue analysis has been carried out and results indicate that bus angle deviation signal as an auxiliary control signal for SVC was able to damp most of the modes leaving some of them still oscillatory. The main feature of the proposed work is to use a combination of the deviation in speed and electrical power output of the generator as input signals to PSS which operates simultaneously along with SVC. Such a simultaneous PSS and SVC scheme is found to improve power system damping under large disturbances, i.e. the growth of system oscillations is arrested. Control simulations are carried out on PSCAD. The efficacy of controllers to damp SSR under steady state and faulted conditions, where one of the torsional modes is excited, is presented and discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-12-10T06:37:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T08:54:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:57:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-12-10T06:37:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T08:54:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:57:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Proceeding of the 20th International Conference on Power Industry Computer Applications, Columbus, USA, 11-16 May 1997, 302-308</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-3713-1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1109/PICA.1997.599418</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/254</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/254</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
