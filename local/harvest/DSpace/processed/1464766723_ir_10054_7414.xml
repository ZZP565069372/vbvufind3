The film morphology Studied by conductive AFM revealed the higher conductivity crystalline domains of the film. We also use transmission electron microscopy in bright-field and dark-field imaging modes, as well as selected area electron diffraction (SAED) to study the single crystal and polycrystalline regions of the films. SAED of single crystals showed diffraction pattern with well-defined spots. Rectangular symmetry is observed for the first time for PANI single crystals. The film regions with polycrystalline domains showed diffraction pattern with sharp rings. The indexing was carried out based on the orthorhombic structure and the unit cell parameters obtained are a=4.2 angstrom, b=5.9 angstrom and c=9.8 angstrom. The nanocrystallite size distribution obtained from C-AFM is in the range of 10-60nm and corroborates well with the TEM data.
