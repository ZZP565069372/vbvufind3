Server side component models have considerably simplified development and the complexity has now shifted to the operational side of these applications. The increase in operational complexity has reached a point where it is no longer feasible for humans to manage the applications required to run an enterprise. The initial steps to provide self managing applications are now being taken -- a paradigm known as "autonomic computing" is in it's infancy of evolution. There have been numerous proposed models of how one achieves self management. In this position paper, we formulate the research problems and basis for "lights out" management of enterprise application environments.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Association for Computing Machinery</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-06-19T06:37:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T08:39:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:57:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-19T06:37:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T08:39:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:57:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:identifier>Proceedings of the 4th international workshop on Software and performance, ( WOSP'04), Redwood Shores, California, United states, 14-16 Jan. 2004, 171-173</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1-58113-673-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1145/974044.974072</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1530</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1530</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
