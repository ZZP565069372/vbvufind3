The microstructure and texture evolution of caliber rolled bar during annealing at 300 degrees C was investigated for 5 to 6000 min. The grain growth from 6 to 17 lm was observed. The grain growth was noted to be faster initially but it became sluggish after similar to 60 min of annealing. The changes in pole figure intensity, mis-orientation angle, kernel average mis-orientation and grain orientation spread were observed after caliber rolling and after annealing. The microstructure and presence of twins after caliber rolling play a vital role in formation of texture after annealing. The changes in microstructure and texture were analysed and the mechanisms involved are discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER INDIA</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-14T12:47:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-14T12:47:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>TRANSACTIONS OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF METALS, 68(2SI)S317-S321</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0972-2815</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0975-1645</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12666-015-0621-x</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17534</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
