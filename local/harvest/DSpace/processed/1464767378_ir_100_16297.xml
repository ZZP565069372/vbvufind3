It is found that Cr substitution suppresses the antiferromagnetic phase present in parent Fe2MnSi, which completely disappears for x = 0.2. Curie temperature of the alloys increases from 230 K to 299 K as x is increased from 0 to 0.2. The value of the Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio indicates that the system shows iterant magnetism. Resistivity measurements also show absence of antiferromagnetic phase for x = 0.2. Resistivity data have been fitted by considering the electron-phonon and electron-magnon scattering contributions, which indicates the presence of half metallicity in these compounds. Temperature dependence of resistivity data shows magnetoresistance of -3% and -2.5% at Curie temperature with applied field of 50 kOe for x = 0.1 and 0.2, respectively.
