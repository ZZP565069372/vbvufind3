The structures of 1 and 2 were determined to reveal a Ru(III)/o-benzosemiquinone formulation, supported by analysis of experimental data (spectroscopy, magnetism of 1) and by DFT calculations. The S = 1 ground state calculated for 1 stands in contrast to the spin-paired analogues with arylimino-o-benzosemiquinonato and diimino-o-benzoquinone ligands. The close contacts of about 5.3 angstrom possible between semiquinone O atoms of different molecules in the crystal allow for intermolecular spin-spin interactions and an overall complex magnetic behavior. One quasireversible oxidation and two reversible one-electron reductions yielded the corresponding molecular ions, which were characterized by UV-visible-NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry in terms of [Ru(III)(acac)(2)(Q(0))](+), [Ru(III)(acac)(2)(Q(2-))](-), and [Ru(II)(acac)(2)(Q(2-))](2-) descriptions in agreement with DFT results. The use of acceptor-substituted 1,2-dioxolenes resulted in the isolation of ionic species Na[Ru(acac)(2)(Q)] (Na(5); Q = 4-chloro-o-benzoquinone) and Na(6) (Q = 4-nitro-o-benzoquinone), which were similarly investigated as compounds 1-4. Magnetic susceptibility and EPR results confirm an S = 1/2 ground state based on ruthenium(III). The combined studies reveal a remarkable substituent sensitivity, and in comparison to recently analyzed Ru(acac)(2) complexes with o-benzoquinone monoimine and diimine ligands, the all-O-donor-containing new systems are distinguished by a qualitatively different metal-ligand interaction based on closer intermolecular radical-radical contacts and on weaker intramolecular d pi-pi* interactions.</dc:description><dc:publisher>WILEY-BLACKWELL</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-06-26T04:45:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-06-26T04:45:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL,17(39)11030-11040</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0947-6539</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chem.201101009</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/13896</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
