The biofilm acclimation was achieved in 55-60 days with gradual increase in TCE concentration from 1 mg/l to 100 mg/l with a parallel increase in the concentration of substrate sodium acetate and other nutrients. COD and TCE concentration were taken as prime parameters for monitoring the growth of biofilm. During acclimation COD removal varied beta een 54.6-97.5% while TCE was removed 72.6-99.9%. HRT study was performed after acclimation. The removal efficiency increased with decreasing flow rate with maximum TCE removal (99.99%) at 6 l/d corresponding to an HRT of 28 h (TF 18 h+ASP 10 h). This was followed by a C:N:P ratio study. A ratio of 100:20:1 led to the sustenance of maximum TCE removal. h Maximum TCE removal (99.99%) was observed at a substrate: cosubstrate ratio of 100:1. A pH of 7.4 +/- 0.2 was found to be optimum for degradation. Finally, volatilization losses were estimated to be 18.5%. A mass balance gave an efficiency of 81.51% for biological removal of TCE.
