The etch characteristics and root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness are studied as a function of process parameters viz. process pressure, Cl-2 percentage in total flow rate ratio, and RF sample power at a constant ICP power, to achieve moderate GaN etch rate with anisotropic profiles and smooth surface morphology. The etch rate and resultant surface roughness of etched surface increased with pressure mainly due to dominant reactant limited etch regime. The etch rate and surface roughness show strong dependence on RF sample power with the former increasing and the later decreasing with the applied RF sample power up to 80 W. The process etch yield variation with applied RF sample power is also reported. The studied etch parameters result in highly anisotropic mesa structures with Ga rich etched surface.
