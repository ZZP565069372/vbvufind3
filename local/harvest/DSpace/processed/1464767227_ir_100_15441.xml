The recovery kinetics, studied through a combination of X-ray line profile analysis and high resolution electron diffraction, were best represented by logarithmic relationship. Though the kinetics was dependent on the prior deformation, gamma(ND//&lt; 111 &gt;) fibre clearly had stronger recovery than theta(ND/&lt; 100 &gt;) fibre. Recovery was observed, statistically to create grain interior strain localizations: an orientation independent phenomenon. Increase in misorientation across such strain localizations was, however, orientation dependent. This was responsible for enhanced in-grain misorientation in recovered gamma-fibre grains/bands. Extended recovery of 80% pre-deformed samples also led to coarsening of gamma-fibre bands: strain induced boundary migration (SIBM) or uniform movement of gamma-fibre boundaries into neighbouring non gamma-fibre orientations.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IRON STEEL INST JAPAN KEIDANREN KAIKAN</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T06:32:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T06:32:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ISIJ INTERNATIONAL, 52(5)884-893</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15441</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
