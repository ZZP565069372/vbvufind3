Six technology alternatives were considered, which were ranked by adopting the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). At each stage, starting from project identification to project synthesis, people's participation was sought in a true sense. This required design of novel strategies embedded in local culture, values, and language. The overall process yielded a participatory decision making method for a community, which would uphold people's involvement, a sense of ownership, and control at each step, which is required for the successful implementation and sustainable operation of the project.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IWA PUBLISHING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-29T06:34:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-29T06:34:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>WATER POLICY, 16(1)39-61</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1366-7017</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wp.2013.113</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17321</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
