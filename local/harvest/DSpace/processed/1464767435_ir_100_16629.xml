The change in obliquity of the projectile during ballistic impact has been studied. The nature of obliquity change depends on the behavior of the target material just after impact and its surface condition. Various energy absorbing mechanisms of the target considered are compression of the target directly below the projectile, compression in the region surrounding the impacted zone, tension in the layers, compression in the lateral direction, shear plugging, friction, matrix cracking and delamination. Analytical predictions are validated with the experimental results. Experimental studies were performed on 4-8mm thick twill weave fabric E-glass/epoxy composite specimens up to obliquity of 30 degrees. Parametric studies have been carried out on the same target material of 19mm thickness for the same range of obliquities. Energy absorbed by different mechanisms, change in projectile obliquity, ballistic limit velocity and damage shape and size has been presented. Trends in ballistic limit velocity with the initial projectile obliquity were observed to be different for 4mm and 19mm thick specimens.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-28T12:56:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-28T12:56:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DAMAGE MECHANICS, 23(4)453-482</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1056-7895</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1530-7921</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1056789513499268</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/16629</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
