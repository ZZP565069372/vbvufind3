However, there has been no well-formulated research on the two together - on how IT can support a quality benchmarking project. Quality benchmarking supported by IT is presented in this paper. The critical role of IT in quality benchmarking is described. Defining the features of quality benchmarking, an eight-step approach to benchmarking processes using IT is presented. The major types of processes along with the IT tools in each type of process are defined. Specific IT applications are also described which emphasize the role of IT In quality benchmarking. Finally, the authors conclude that benchmarking supported by IT demonstrates speedy and reliable quality benchmarking.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INST ELECTRONICS TELECOMMUNICATION ENGINEERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-03T05:52:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-03T05:52:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW, 18(1), 17-21</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0255-9609</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8916</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8916</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
