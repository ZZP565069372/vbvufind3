The details of the adoption of the MCCI technique in the EFG method are described. Its performance is demonstrated through a number of case studies including mixed-mode and thermal problems in linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The results are compared with published theoretical solutions and those based on the displacement method, stress method, crack closure integral in conjunction with local smoothing (CCI-LS) technique, as well as the M-integral method. its advantages are discussed.
