As compared to the similar single-layer quantum-dot (SQD) structure, the bilayer quantum-dot (BQD) structure showed a more uniform spatial distribution and increased size homogeneity of the dots. It also exhibited longer wavelength photoluminescence (PL) emission at room temperature, with the peak at a wavelength (1.34 mu m) in the infrared communication window. The shift seen in the low temperature PL emission peak, even after annealing the BQD samples at temperatures up to 700A degrees C, is negligible. However, the BQD samples showed an activation energy lower than that of the SQD sample, attributed to the In/Ga interdiffusion with the thin (8.5 nm thick) GaAs spacer layer during the growth process. Despite that, the higher thermal stability demonstrated by the BQD structure, along with a lower linewidth, makes the bilayer quantum dots a desirable proposition for efficient lasing devices requiring strict tolerances on operating wavelength.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-06-26T05:14:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-06-26T05:14:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE &amp; PROCESSING,103(1)245-250</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0947-8396</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00339-010-6005-5</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/13942</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
