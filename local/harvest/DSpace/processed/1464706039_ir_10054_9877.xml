The cyclic stress-strain curve in the double logarithmic plot shows a linear relation for both steels. A transition of the cyclic stress-strain curve from softening to hardening with increasing strain amplitude has been observed with respect to the corresponding tensile curve. The strain amplitude for the onset of cyclic softening to hardening transition has been found to be dependent on grain size. The strain lifetime behaviour, estimated from modified universal slopes equation, shows similar trends as Nb or V bearing microalloyed steels. The cyclic characteristics of the two microalloyed steels have been compared with corresponding predeformed state carried out under stress controlled conditions. While, cyclic saturation was observed in case where the extent of predeformation was within the Luders strain, cyclic softening occurred when it exceeded the Luders strain. It has been attempted to provide a mechanistic understanding of the differences in the cyclic behaviour of the two steels owing to the microstructure and predeformation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MANEY PUBLISHING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-17T12:58:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-17T12:58:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, 25(6), 760-769</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0267-0836</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/174328408X332834</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9877</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9877</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
