They were then pressed sintered repressed and hot-pressed to near theoretical density, Sintered density, hardness, electrical conductivity and microstructure of the sintered compacts we've assessed The mechanically alloyed compacts were also subjected to electrical performance evaluation via International Electrotechnical Commission's Standard IEC 947-4-1. Mechanical Alloying has been found to result in on excellent combination of physical microstructural and electrical contact properties.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER POWDER METALLURGY INST</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-17T01:47:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-17T01:47:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POWDER METALLURGY, 34(4), 63-+</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0888-7462</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4584</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4584</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
