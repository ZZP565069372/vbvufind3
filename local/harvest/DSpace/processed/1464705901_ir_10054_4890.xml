Kinetic and isothermal studies showed that the uptake potential of ITS media was much more than IOCS media. The sequence of anions studied competing with respect to As(III) on ITS media was SO42- &gt;HCO31-&gt;Cl-. The presence of Ca2+ ions significantly improved the removal efficiency. During column studies the breakthrough loadings of IOCS (q(b) = 0.042 and 0.068) and IIS (q(b) = 0.097 and 0.217) for water and simulated water, respectively, show that q(b) for IOCS is lower than for ITS under similar experimental conditions. A filter effluent of 68 L of simulated water passed through 250 g IIS contained less than 0.05 mg As/L.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-18T10:58:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-18T10:58:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE, 129(1), 89-92</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0733-9372</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2003)129:1(89)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4890</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4890</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
