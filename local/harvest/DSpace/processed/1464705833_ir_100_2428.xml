The glucose sensitivity was observed to be 0.89%/mM glucose with a linear response in the range of 0-50mM glucose. The sensor response was observed to be completely reversible in nature with a response time of 120 seconds. The system was further demonstrated to respond similarly using near-infrared dyes (Alexa Fluor-647-labeled dextran as donor and QSY-21-conjugated apo-GOx as acceptor) which exhibited a sensitivity of 0.94%/mM glucose with a linear response in range of 0-50mM glucose, making the sensor more amenable to in vivo use, when implanted in scattering tissue.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-25T16:37:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-25T16:37:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>EMBC: 2009 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-20,4098-4101</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-1-4244-3295-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15769</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2428</dc:identifier><dc:source>Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society,Minneapolis, MN,SEP 03-06, 2009</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
