Layered Li(Li0.05Ni0.4Co0.3Mn0.25)O-2 cathode material was prepared by sol-gel technique using citric acid as chelating agent. The prepared sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction, SEM-EDS studies. The crystallite size of the Li(Li0.05Ni0.4Co0.3Mn0.25)O-2 cathode material was about 57 nm in which the diffusion path of lithium ion is effectively possible. The complexation behavior of prepared cathode material was analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy. The electrical properties of the prepared Li(Li0.05Ni0.4Co0.3Mn0.25)O-2 cathode material was studied by impedance and dielectric spectral analyzes. The maximum ionic conductivity of Li(Li0.05Ni0.4Co0.3Mn0.25)O-2 was found to be in the order of 10-3.4 S/cm. The dielectric analysis of cathode material confirms the non-Debye type behavior.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE MONTREAL</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-29T06:39:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-29T06:39:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF NEW MATERIALS FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS, 17(3)153-158</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1480-2422</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17331</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
