In 1-3 the alkoxide bridged dicopper building units, [Cu(m-hep)](2) with Cu(2)O(2) core, are linked via the respective anions. Detailed structural analysis reveals that in 1 or 2, two units of NO(3)(-) (1) or PhOAc 2 (2), respectively, bind with the four copper ions in two adjacent alkoxide bridged dimeric units in head-to-head and tail-to-tail fashion and the same binding mode continues along the polymeric chain. This in effect yields a 12-membered metallacyclic ring in between two dimeric core units. However, in 3 only one CO(3)(2-) group bridges the two copper centres associated with the two neighbouring alkoxide bridged dimeric units in head-to-tail mode which in turn forms a zig-zag polymeric chain. Two coordinated and two lattice water molecules from two adjacent polymeric layers in the structure of 3 form water tetramers. Furthermore, the interaction of water tetramer with the uncoordinated C=O group of the bridging CO(3)(2-) develops an additional zig-zag chain which is being trapped between the two outer zig-zag coordination polymeric chains in 3. The polymeric chains in 1-3 further develop a 2D-network pattern via an extensive non-covalent hydrogen bonding as well as C-H center dot center dot center dot pi and pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-06-26T09:34:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-06-26T09:34:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>RSC ADVANCES,1(5)893-902</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>2046-2069</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1ra00155h</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14299</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
