When N-alkyl derivatives are reacted with paraformaldehyde, dimerization takes place to afford bis(phosphine oxide)s of the type Ph2P(O)CH2N(R)CH2P(O)Ph-2 (R = Me, Pr-n, Bu-n). Aminobis(phosphines) also undergo methylene insertion when treated with paraformaldehyde to give bis(phosphine oxides) Ph2P(O)CH2N(R)CH2P(O)Ph-2 (R = Me, Et, Pr-n, Pr-i, Bu-n) in good yield. The reaction of aminophosphines with aromatic aldehydes ArCHO leads to insertion of "ArCH" into the P-N bond to give Ph2P(O)CH(R)N(H)Ph (R = C6H5, furfuryl, o-C6H4OH), but with aliphatic aldehydes such as butanal, P-N bond cleavage takes place to afford alpha-hydroxy phosphine oxide. The reaction of aminobis(phosphines) with both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes leads to the formation of alpha-hydroxy phosphine oxides through P-N bond cleavage whereas the reaction with furfural leads to the P-N bond insertion. The structure of the alpha-hydroxy derivative Ph2P(O)CR(H)(OH)Pr-n shows intermolecular hydrogen bonding between OH and P=O oxygen. The phosphine oxide derivatives act as bidentate ligands and form chelate complexes with Co(II), Mo(VI), Th(IV), and U(VI) derivatives. The crystal structure of the molybdenum complex, cis-[MoO2Cl2{(OPPh2CH2)(2)NEt-kappaO,kappaO}], shows the distorted octahedral geometry around Mo with two oxo groups cis to each other.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-14T08:23:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-14T08:23:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 42(4), 1272-1281</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0020-1669</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic026118t</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/3908</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/3908</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
