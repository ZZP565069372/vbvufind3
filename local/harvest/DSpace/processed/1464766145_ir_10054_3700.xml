The rule of spin alternation in the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) method clearly shows that the radical sites are antiferromagnetically coupled in 3 and ferromagnetically coupled in 4 and 5, which is consistent with a previous experiment. The molecular geometries are optimized at Hartree-Fock levels. This is followed by single-point calculations using the density functional (UB3LYP) treatment and the multiconfigurational complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) methodology. Magnetic exchange coupling constants are determined from the broken-symmetry approach. The calculated J values, -3.60 cm(-1) for 3, 0.16 cm(-1) for 4, and 0.67 cm(-1) for 5, are in excellent agreement with the observed values. Because of the very large size of the diradicals 3-5, the CASSCF (10,10) calculations cannot yield realistic J values. Nevertheless, the CASSCF calculations support the antiferromagnetic nature of the magnetic coupling in 3 and the ferromagnetic nature of the coupling in 4 and 5. The existence of an intramolecular magnetic coupling in 3-5 is also confirmed through computations of the isotropic hyperfine coupling constants for monoradicals 1 and 2 as well as diradicals 3-5.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-13T14:54:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-13T14:54:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A, 109(28), 6272-6278</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1089-5639</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp050282v</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/3700</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/3700</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
