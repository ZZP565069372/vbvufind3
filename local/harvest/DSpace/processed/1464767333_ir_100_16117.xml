As-received (AR) specimens of type 304 SS were given two solution-annealing treatments at 1000 degrees C for 0.5 and 2 h. Solution-annealed specimens were given a small strain of 5% using cold-rolling followed by strain-annealing (strain-annealing) at 927 degrees C for 24, 48, and 72 h. Electron backscatter diffraction analyses have shown increase in fraction of special boundaries (Sigma &lt;= 29) in two solution-annealed specimens. Twin-boundary engineered specimens were given two potential sensitisation treatments at 575 and 675 degrees C for 1 h. The increase in twin fraction and decrease in grain average misorientation (GAM) always resulted in reducing the extent of sensitisation. An exponential correlation between GAM and twin-fraction was established and increase in GAM always associated with increase in twin-fraction. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
