This is only possible as the molecule has a hinged cis arrangement about the Pd2+ coordination spheres. For this hinged dimeric structure, the angles between the two coordination planes in each molecule are 15.02 (5) and 14.91 (5)degrees. This hinged cis arragement also allows the two molecules to form pairs linked by secondary interactions between the Pd and Se atoms [3.4307 (9) and 3.4317 (9) angstrom] of adjoining molecules, leading to an overall tetrameric structure. During the refinement stages, it was noticed that there were dichloromethane solvent molecules present disordered about a twofold axis. After unsuccessful attempts were made to model this, they were removed using SQUEEZE.</dc:description><dc:publisher>WILEY-BLACKWELL</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-17T04:15:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-17T04:15:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION E-STRUCTURE REPORTS ONLINE, 68M113-U352</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S1600536811055322</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15923</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
