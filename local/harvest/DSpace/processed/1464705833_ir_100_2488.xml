Many leading educational and professional organizations have large repositories of animations, created using Java applets which are mostly for desktops. Use of mobile phones is increasing especially amongst students, and creating new eLearning content for mobile phones is resource intensive. It is desirable to have a methodology to adapt existing Java animations on mobile phones. This paper presents a methodology (APP2MID) which converts the Java applet into Java MIDIet that can run on mobile phones. The conversion methodology is divided in three logical phases and will help the user to create MIDIets from the available Java applets, maintaining the original programming logic. We illustrate this methodology using a case study.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-25T21:01:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-25T21:01:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>2009 SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EMERGING TRENDS IN ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY (ICETET 2009),942-945</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-1-4244-5250-7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15820</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2488</dc:identifier><dc:source>2nd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology (ICETET09),Nagpur, INDIA,DEC 16-18, 2009</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
