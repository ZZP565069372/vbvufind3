It is shown that the well-known super twisting control (STC), which replaces the discontinuous part of the ISMC acts as a disturbance observer, and hence, cancels the matched disturbance. As the overall controller is continuous the proposed method is advantageous over the existing ISMC, which has a discontinuous term. Also from the practical implementation point of view, in particular for mechanical systems, discontinuous term will result in chattering, which is undesirable. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on a practical system and its superiority has been demonstrated.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T09:30:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T09:30:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS, 20(5)2194-2204</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1083-4435</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1941-014X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2014.2368717</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/18256</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
