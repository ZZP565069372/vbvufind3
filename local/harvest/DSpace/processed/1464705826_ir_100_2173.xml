Despite, the information on emissive properties of TIR data that is complementary to the reflective properties of the VIS and NIR data, the application of TIR data has been rather restricted, mainly due to its coarse spatial resolution. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have proved to be far superior [1][2] to the statistical methods in many applications. Studies have been carried out on the applicability of ANN in the improvement of effective spatial resolution of Landsat-5, TM band 6 (TIR) daytime and nighttime data. The present paper reports the methodology developed and the results of the studies. The results are compared with those of a statistical approach.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-24T11:53:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-24T11:53:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>2ND GRSS/ISPRS JOINT WORKSHOP ON REMOTE SENSING AND DATA FUSION OVER URBAN AREAS,162-166</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-7719-2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DFUA.2003.1219979</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15412</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2173</dc:identifier><dc:source>2nd GRS/ISPRS Joint Workshop on Remote Sensing and Data Fusion over Urban Areas,BERLIN, GERMANY,MAY 22-23, 2003</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
