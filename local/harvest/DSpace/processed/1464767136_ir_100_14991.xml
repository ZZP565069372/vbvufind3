The conjugate L has been found to recognize Cu2+ among the thirteen different metal ions studied by exhibiting ratiometric fluorescence changes through newly generated excimer band at similar to 380 nm. Fluorescence off-on-off behavior has been clearly demonstrated on the basis of the binding variability of Cu2+ to L. The binding has been elicited through the changes observed in the fluorescence, ESI MS and H-1 NMR titrations. All the other metal ions studied do not show any new band and further do not interfere with the recognition of Cu2+ by L, even when these are present in the same medium. The structural features of both the mono- and di-nuclear complexes were established by DFT computational calculations and found to display highly distorted geometry about the copper centers that deviate from both the tetrahedral and the square planar.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T13:21:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T13:21:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>DALTON TRANSACTIONS, 41(35)10652-10660</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2dt30432e</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14991</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
