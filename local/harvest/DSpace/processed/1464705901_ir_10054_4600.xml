The specific interactions existing between the Na+ moieties in Surlyn and the pi electron clouds of MWNT were supported by FTIR and Raman spectroscopic analysis. SAXS scattering patterns were found to be progressively broadened in presence of MWNT in Surlyn/MWNT composites. Morphological investigations revealed selective clustering of MWNT in the vicinity of the ionic domains in Surlyn. Further, the domain size of the ionic clusters was found to increase with increasing MWNT content disrupting the ionic pairs apart in the ionic domain. The melt rheological response of Surlyn was significantly affected in presence of MWNT and was profoundly dependent on the ionic clusters. The state of dispersion of MWNT was assessed by AC electrical conductivity measurements. The associated percolation threshold was observed between 1.5-2 wt% of MWNT.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-17T02:59:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-17T02:59:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY, 8(4), 1721-1727</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1533-4880</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2008.031</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4600</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4600</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
