The R-BIAN framework with R = H, however, leads to the selective formation of partially hydrolyzed BIAO ([N-(phenyl)imino]acenapthenone)-derived complex [Ru-II(tpm)(BIAO)Cl]ClO4 ([2]ClO4). The redox-sensitive bond parameters involving -N=C-C=N- or -N=C-C=O of BIAN or BIAO in the crystals of representative [1a]ClO4, [3a](PF6)(2), or [2]ClO4 establish its unreduced form. The chloro derivatives 1a(+)-1d(+) and 2(+) exhibit one oxidation and successive reduction processes in CH3CN within the potential limit of +/- 2.0 V versus SCE, and the redox potentials follow the order 1a(+) &lt; 1b(+) &lt; 1c(+) &lt; 1d(+) approximate to 2(+). The electronic structural aspects of 1a(n)-1d(n) and 2(n) (n = +2, +1, 0, -1, -2, -3) have been assessed by UV-vis and EPR spectroelectrochemistry, DFT-calculated MO compositions, and Mulliken spin density distributions in paramagnetic intermediate states which reveal metal-based (Ru-II -&gt; Ru-III) oxidation and primarily BIAN- or BIAO-based successive reduction processes. The aqua complex 3a(2+) undergoes two proton-coupled redox processes at 0.56 and 0.85 V versus SCE in phosphate buffer (pH 7) corresponding to {Ru-II-H2O}/{Ru-III-OH} and {Ru-III-OH}/{Ru-IV=O}, respectively. The chloro (1a(+)-1d(+)) and aqua (3a(2+)) derivatives are found to be equally active in functioning as efficient precatalysts toward the epoxidation of a wide variety of alkenes in the presence of PhI(OAc)(2) as oxidant in CH2Cl2 at 298 K, though the analogous 2(+) remains virtually inactive. The detailed experimental analysis with the representative precatalyst 1a(+) suggests the involvement of the active {Ru-IV=O} species in the catalytic cycle, and the reaction proceeds through the radical mechanism, as also supported by the DFT calculations.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:05:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:05:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 54(10)4998-5012</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0020-1669</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1520-510X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b00615</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17887</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
