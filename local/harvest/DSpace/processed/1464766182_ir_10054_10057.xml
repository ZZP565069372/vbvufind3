The coexistence of ferroelectric and magnetic domains in specific spatial area of the thin film was also confirmed by scanning probe imaging. As expected, the magnetization values obtained for Bi0.6Dy0.3La0.1FeO3 bulk and thin films were higher than those of Bi0.6Tb0.3La0.1FeO3 bulk and polycrystalline thin films because the magnetic moment of Dy is higher than that of Tb. However, preferentially oriented thin films of Bi0.6Tb0.3La0.1FeO3 exhibit much higher magnetization values. It is speculated that structural alignment caused by stress developed during deposition of these films could be responsible for enhancement in magnetization.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MATERIALS RESEARCH SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-18T15:23:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-18T15:23:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH, 22(8), 2068-2073</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0884-2914</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1557/jmr.2007.0285</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10057</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10057</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
