The rates of conversion of alcohols to carbon dioxide was found to decrease in the order methanol &gt; ethanol &gt; 2-propanol &gt; 1-propanol, with the difference in reactivity attributed to the stability of the carbon-centered radicals formed during photo-oxidation. Kinetics revealed that the photo-oxidation of alcohols followed a first-order reaction. A detailed in situ FT-IR analysis was used to identify the transient species formed during the photo-oxidation of ethanol and 2-propanof over uranyl-anchored photocatalyst. Acetic acid, ethyl acetate, and acetaldehyde were the intermediates obtained over UO22+/MCM-41 during photo-oxidation of ethanol, whereas acetate species, methyl acetate, and acetone were detected during photo-oxidation of 2-propanol. Based on the intenriediate species formed, their growth with respect to irradiation time, and their intensities, appropriate reaction mechanisms were proposed to corroborate our observations.
