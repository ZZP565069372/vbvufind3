Target compounds 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) present in two simulated waste-waters at a concentration of 30 mg/l each individually were sequentially treated in continuous mode by combined UASB-I, RBC-I and combined UASB-II, RBC-II reactors, respectively after the acclimation of their biomass with the corresponding chlorophenol. Reactor combinations took 190 and 215 days for acclimation with 30 mg/l of 2-CP and 2,4-DCP respectively. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) studies showed that 12 h HRT of UASB-I and 23 h HRT of RBC-I as well as 12 h HRT of UASB-II and 28.8 h HRT of RBC-II were the optimum combinations for the treatment of simulated wastewater containing 2-CP and 2,4-DCP respectively. Optimum HRT combinations produced 2-CP and 2,4-DCP effluent having corresponding chlorophenol concentration of below detectable limit (BDL) and 0.1 mg/l respectively. Half velocity coefficients (K,) for 2-CP and 2,4-DCP biodegradation in UASB reactors were determined to be 5.07 mg 2-CP/l and 6.49 mg 2,4-DCP/l. Optimum ratio of substrate (chlorophenol): co-substrate (sodium acetate) was 1:100.
