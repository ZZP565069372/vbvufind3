Powder x-ray diffraction and temperature dependence of magnetization studies reveal that with the addition of Fe in the Mn site, the martensitic transition shifts to low temperatures. It is also found that the martensitic transition becomes broader with the increase of Fe concentration. The metamagnetic transition in M(H) isotherms becomes very prominent in x = 2 and vanishes for x = 3 and 4. A maximum positive magnetic entropy change of 14.2 J/kg K is observed for x = 2 at 288 K for 50 kOe. Electrical resistivity data show an abrupt decrease across the martensitic transition in all the alloys, except x = 6, which does not have a martensitic transition. A maximum negative magnetoresistance of 21% has been obtained for x = 2 at 50 kOe. The same alloy also shows an exchange bias field of 288 Oe. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.
