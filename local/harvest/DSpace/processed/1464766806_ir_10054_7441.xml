These derivatives were subjected to the binding studies with the divalent metal ions, viz., Mg2+ Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ using fluorescence and absorption spectra. The imine moiety that is in conjugation with the anthryl unit is responsible for quenching the fluorescence in the absence of metal ion, however, in the presence of Fe2+ and Cu2+, the spectra showed very high enhancement in fluorescence intensity indicating that the lone pair present on the imine-N is involved in the metal ion binding and as a result the photo-induced electron transfer is prevented. Based on the photo-physical studies, it has been found that the anthracene derivative that is coupled with the calix[4]arene unit through an imine bond acts as a chemosensor for Fe2+ and Cu2+. The fluorescence studies are further augmented by the absorption spectra.
