CFD-ACE+ is used as numerical tool for analyzing flow through channels with designed roughness elements. mu-PIV is used for characterizing the flow through straight and serpentine sections of the channels. Such laser-based non-intrusive measurement technique is also used to characterize a microfluidic device meant for detection of multiple species. This device is fabricated from a mask using Excimer laser and species detection is achieved by balancing the pressure driven flow with the applied electric field. This device can be used for separation of biological species. In a parallel effort, experimental and numerical investigation of mechanics of affinity cantilevers for biosensor application has been carried out. A new model based on electrostatic repulsion between charged antigens has been proposed. Fabrication of biosensor is carried out on our Excimer laser. A characterization tool, micromap 5010, is used to measure static displacements resulting from bioactivity. A microfabrication facility to fabricate three-dimensional microstructures based on microstereolithography principles has been developed here. This facility will be useful for fabrication and further analysis (using mu-PIV) of flow through complex biological structures. Overall the SMA mu L has a solid foundation laid for investigation of complex microchannel flow, heat transfer, biosensors and other MEMS devices.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T13:25:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T13:25:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Nanochannels, Microchannnels, and Minichannels, Pts A and B,1307-1314</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-0-7918-4760-2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16022</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2618</dc:identifier><dc:source>4th International Conference on Nanochannels, Microchannels, and Minichannels,Limerick, IRELAND,JUN 19-21, 2006</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
