The coatings used at high temperature should have low reaction rates with the environment, remain adherent and form protective oxides at the temperature of operation. Most of these coatings are divided into three main categories, conventional, modified and advanced coatings. Conventional coatings such as aluminide silicides which are very common fail in aggressive environments. Several modifications to these coatings by addition of other elements have improved the coating performance considerably. Many new and Latest techniques are also discussed, which not only improve coating characteristics but also improve their efficiency.</dc:description><dc:publisher>METAL FINISHERS ASSOC INDIA</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-18T17:42:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-18T17:42:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>1995</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>TRANSACTIONS OF THE METAL FINISHERS ASSOCIATION OF INDIA, 4(1), 57-66</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0971-5304</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10089</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10089</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
