An alternative to blending is coating the base titanium powders with specific metal ions by an electroless route to maximise advantages associated with homogeneous coating. In this work, Ni-P is being used as the coating material, to coat hydrogenated/dehydrogenated titanium powders. The particle size distribution of uncoated and coated powders was used to explain the change in tap density. A diametrical compression test was carried out to evaluate green strength of the particles when consolidated before and after coating.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MANEY PUBLISHING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-14T13:36:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-14T13:36:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS, 1785-89</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1432-8917</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1433-075X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/1432891713Z.000000000296</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14517</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
