A striking contrast was observed in its non-linear transmission characteristics at different argon-ion laser wavelengths. The non-linear transmission characteristics exhibit strong saturation behaviour at 457.9 nm whilst at 476.5 nm and 488.0 nm the response is dominated by intense excited state absorption. The experimental observations are explained using the four-level saturable absorber model. The excited state absorption cross-section, saturation intensity, light induced absorption and refraction changes have been determined along with the sign of the non-linearity at various argon laser wavelengths. The optical limiting characteristics of fluorescein at 476.5 nm and 457.9 nm are also reported. The behaviour of the sample was in agreement with the Z-scan observations.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CHAPMAN HALL LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-20T07:36:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-20T07:36:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS, 29(5), 567-578</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0306-8919</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018524121240</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5395</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5395</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
