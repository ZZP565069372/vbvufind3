The technique involves interferometric phase comparison of successive SAR images. The results so far available related to the above technique are limited and there is a need to conduct further experiments to strengthen the earlier results. Taking advantage of ERS-1 and 2 tandem operation, experiments were conducted to simulate Earth crust movement by installing corner reflectors (CRs). The CRs were exclusively designed, fabricated and installed for the simulation. From April to June 1996, the corner reflectors were lifted systematically with tandem passes and accurately measured on the ground. The movements will be estimated using differential SAR interferometric technique.</dc:description><dc:publisher>EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-23T06:18:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-23T06:18:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>THIRD ERS SYMPOSIUM ON SPACE AT THE SERVICE OF OUR ENVIRONMENT, VOL 1,414,429-433</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>92-9092-656-2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0379-6566</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15057</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/1807</dc:identifier><dc:source>3rd ERS Symposium on Space at the Service of Our Environment,FLORENCE, ITALY,MAR 14-21, 1997</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
