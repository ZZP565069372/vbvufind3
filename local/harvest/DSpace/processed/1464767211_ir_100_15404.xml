This innovative sensor was constructed with glassy carbon electrode which is represented as (GOx)/CA-CF/(GCE). An explicit high negative zeta potential value (-22.4 mV at pH 7.0) was observed on the surface of CA-CF MNPs. Our sensor works on the principle of detection of H2O2 which is produced by the enzymatic oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid. This sensor has tremendous potential for application in glucose biosensing due to the higher sensitivity 2.5 mu A/cm(2)-mM and substantial increment of the anodic peak current from 0.2 mu A to 10.5 mu A.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T06:02:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T06:02:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article; Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY, 12(8)6631-6638</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2012.4570</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15404</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
