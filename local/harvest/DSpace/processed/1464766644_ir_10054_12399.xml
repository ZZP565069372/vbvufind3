The present article describes a design of the online failure monitoring facility for mechanical face seals. The experimental test facility is to operate the seal (i.e., carbon-graphite) in real conditions of fluid pressure, temperature, and misalignment, which occur in an industrial environment. The developed test setup consists of two proximity displacement sensors (accuracy 2 mu m), one fiber-optic sensor (accuracy 10 mu m), one accelerometer (3.97mV/ms(-2)), and one Non-contact torque sensor (accuracy 0.05 N.m). To validate the test facility, a typical conical carbon graphite (C = 59.195%, O = 4.625%, and Sb = 36.18%.) mechanical face seal (outer dia = 82 mm and inner dia = 63 mm) for a rotary joint used in steam/hot water was selected. The root cause of failure of such seals has been identified. Finally, recommendations have been made that provide some assistance to design the mechanical face seal.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-30T16:57:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-30T16:57:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>TRIBOLOGY TRANSACTIONS, 52(1), 47-58</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1040-2004</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402000802163017</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12399</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12399</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
