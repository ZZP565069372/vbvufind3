An example is the ability to collaboratively modify access control policies based on the evolution of the group and trust and behavior levels. In this paper we propose a new framework for dynamic multi-level access control policies based on trust and reputation. The framework has interesting features wherein the group can switch between policies over time, influenced by the system's state or environment. Based on the behavior and trust level of peers in the group and the current group composition, it is possible for peers to collaboratively modify policies such as join, update and job allocation. We have modeled the framework using the declarative language Prolog. We also performed some simulations to illustrate the features of our framework.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-28T00:44:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-28T00:44:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOLS 1-8,861-865</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-1-4244-3434-3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1550-3607</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16463</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2939</dc:identifier><dc:source>IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2009),Dresden, GERMANY,JUN 14-18, 2009</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
