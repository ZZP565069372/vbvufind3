An alternative self-organizing design based on a heterarchical structure has been put forward in recent years. This study examined the prediction of four components of organizational effectiveness of organizations varying in structure. Participants were final-year university engineering students and engineers working in a large public enterprise in India. Comparative analysis has shown significant improvement in organizational effectiveness under a heterarchical structure. The results are discussed within the structural perspective of the organizations.</dc:description><dc:publisher>HELDREF PUBLICATIONS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-19T14:02:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-19T14:02:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>1992</dc:date><dc:type>Article; Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,132(2)223-231</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-4545</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/14430</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/1242</dc:identifier><dc:source>NATIONAL SEMINAR ON APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY IN INDIA,BHOPAL, INDIA,FEB 10-12, 1987</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
