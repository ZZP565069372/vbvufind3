Analytical expressions for velocity profiles in the core region and peripheral plasma layer alongwith flow rate, effective viscosity and effective Reynolds number have been obtained. Some interesting limitng cases have also been discussed. It may be noticed that the flow of suspensions has the tendency to leave a particle free layer near the wall, thereby decreasing the effective viscosity. This may be used in reducing the dialysis time. Because of the movement of red cells towards the centre, plasma exposure area to the membrane increases. Further, due to reduced blockage of membrane pores by the red cells, the membrane exposure area further increases. These two factors further help in reducing the cell injury and the dialysis time.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INDIAN NAT SCI ACAD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-02T15:58:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-02T15:58:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDIAN JOURNAL OF PURE &amp; APPLIED MATHEMATICS, 32(1), 55-68</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0019-5588</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8859</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8859</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
