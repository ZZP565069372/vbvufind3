It was stripped with 1 mol dm-3 hydrochloric acid and determined as its complex with Arsenazo III. It was separated from binary mixtures by exploiting the difference in the extraction behavior from ascorbic acid. Several separations were accomplished by process of selective stripping with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Many interesting separations of scandium from associated elements like yttrium, thorium, uranium, and molybdenum have been carried out.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CHEMICAL SOC JAPAN</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-20T09:06:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-20T09:06:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>1991</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>BULLETIN OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN, 64(2), 655-658</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0009-2673</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1246/bcsj.64.655</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5420</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5420</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
