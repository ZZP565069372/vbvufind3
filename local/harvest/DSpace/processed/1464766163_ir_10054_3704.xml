The method of sulfation does not seem to much affect the surface area, superacidity, and crystalline phases present in the catalysts. However, sulfation by impregnation produces a catalyst with more acid sites in the weak and medium strength region. The catalysts showed high C-8 selectivity comparable to liquid acid catalysts; however, use of 1-butene as olefin feed reduces the selectivity toward trimethylpentanes. Increase of olefin space velocity and reaction temperature increases olefin conversion but dimerization of olefin was favored over alkylation. Although the catalysts last their activity within initial few minutes, they could be regenerated by heating in air. Activity of the regenerated catalysts is slightly lower, but the selectivity remains nearly unchanged.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-13T15:09:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-13T15:09:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ENERGY &amp; FUELS, 12(1), 109-114</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0887-0624</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ef970078+</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/3704</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/3704</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
