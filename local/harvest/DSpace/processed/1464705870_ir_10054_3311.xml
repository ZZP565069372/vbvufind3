In order to study heat treatment response three different routes of hardening heat treatments were applied to RS 17-7 PH steel ribbons. These were (i) direct isochronal ageing, (ii) conventional double hardening treatment and (iii) direct conditioning coupled with isochronal ageing. Conventionally peak aged (PA) melt spun ribbons were found to be (a) 46 per cent harder than CP 17-7 PH steel after identical heat treatment and (6) 43 per cent harder than direct isochronally PA (at 973 degrees K) ribbons. Direct isochronally PA 17-7 PH steel ribbons showed a precipitation of M(23)C(16) predominantly at grain boundaries with a plate like morphology (plates 140 to 300 nm long and 70 to 140 nm wide).</dc:description><dc:publisher>A B ACADEMIC PUBL</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-12T11:34:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-12T11:34:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RAPID SOLIDIFICATION, 9(2), 121-136</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0265-0916</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/3311</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/3311</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
