Reactor RI was used as control, whereas R2, R3, and R4 were fed with 2-nitrophenol (2-NP), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), and 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), respectively. The concentration of each nitrophenol was gradually varied from 2 to 30 mg/l during acclimation. After acclimation reactors were operated under steady-state conditions at four different HRTs - 30, 24, 18, and 12 h, to study its effect on the removal of nitrophenols. Overall removal of 2-NP and 4-NP was always more than 99% but 2,4-DNP removal decreased from 96% to 89.7% as HRT was lowered from 30 to 12 h. 2-Aminophenol (2-AP), 4-aminophenol (4-AP) and 2-amino,4-nitrophenol (2-A,4-NP) were found to be the major intermediates during the degradation of 2-NP, 4-NP and 2,4-DNP, respectively. Out of the total input of nitrophenolic concentration (30 mg/l), on molar basis, about 41.2-48.4% of 2-NP, 59.4-68% of 4-NP, 30-26.6% of 2,4-DNP was recovered in the form of their respective amino derivatives at 30-12 h HRT. COD removal was 98-89%, 97-56%, 97-52%, and 94-46% at 30-12 h HRT for R1, R2, R3 and R4, respectively. Average cell growth was observed to be 0.15 g volatile suspended solid (VSS) per g COD consumed. Methanogenic inhibition was observed at lower HRTs (18 and 12 h), however denitrification was always more than 99% with non-detectable level of nitrite. The granules developed inside the reactors were black in color and their average size varied between 1.9 and 2.1 mm.
