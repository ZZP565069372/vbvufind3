Compressive split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) apparatus was used for the studies. Compressive properties of typical plain weave E-glass/epoxy and plain weave carbon/epoxy were evaluated along all the principal directions in the strain rate range of 680–2890 s−1. It is generally observed that the compressive strength is enhanced at high strain rate loading compared with that at quasi-static loading. During SHPB testing of the specimens, it was observed that the peak force obtained from the strain gage mounted on the transmitter bar is lower than the peak force obtained from the strain gage mounted on the incident bar. The explanation for this is provided based on stress wave attenuation studies.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-02-26T10:45:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T17:56:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:06:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:54:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-02-26T10:45:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T17:56:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:06:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:54:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Materials Science and Engineering: A 474(1-2), 301-311</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0921-5093</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msea.2007.05.032</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/789</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/789</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
