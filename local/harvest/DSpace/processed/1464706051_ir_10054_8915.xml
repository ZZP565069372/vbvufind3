This article discusses some of the major technical challenges in the implementation of IP telephony. One of the challenges in IP telephony is that of delay jitter in the received audio. The problem of jitter in delays needs to be handled even in the newer networks having high bandwidth and low delays. In this paper, we discuss the jitter problem in detail and provide an overview of various methods used to tackle it. These include a new method proposed by the authors which offers performance gains in terms of packet loss and jitter over existing methods.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INST ELECTRONICS TELECOMMUNICATION ENGINEERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-03T05:49:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-03T05:49:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW, 20(4), 289-296</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0255-9609</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8915</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8915</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
