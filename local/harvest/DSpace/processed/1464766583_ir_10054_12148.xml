The source of water is the Tuichhuahen River, flowing from north to south in the area. Water samples were analyzed for their physicochemical and bacteriological characteristics in order to obtain the current quality level of the potable water in the twon. The samples were collected from two different sources, i.e., the supply from the government agency ( PHED) and from the naturally occurring springs (tuikhurs). The results suggest that the water supplied by the PHED is better than that from the tuikhurs; however, the quality of water from both sources, which are used for drinking and domestic purposes, were found to be more or less within the tolerance limits.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T17:36:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T17:36:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES, 61(1), 115-121</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1866-6280</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-009-0326-8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12148</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12148</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
