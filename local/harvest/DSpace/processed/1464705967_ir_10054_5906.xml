The polytope of degree partitions (respectively, degree sequences) is the convex hull of degree partitions (respectively, degree sequences) of all simple graphs on the vertex set [n]. The polytope of degree sequences has been very well studied. In this paper we study the polytope of degree partitions. We show that adding the inequalities x(1) &gt;= x(2) &gt;= ... &gt;= x(n) to a linear inequality description of the degree sequence polytope yields a linear inequality description of the degree partition polytope and we show that the extreme points of the degree partition polytope are the 2(n-1) threshold partitions (these are precisely those extreme points of the degree sequence polytope that have weakly decreasing coordinates). We also show that the degree partition polytope has 2(n-2) (2n - 3) edges and (n(2)-3n + 12)/2 facets, for n &gt;= 4. Our main tool is an averaging transformation on real sequences defined by repeatedly averaging over the ascending runs.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF COMBINATORICS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-21T15:21:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-21T15:21:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF COMBINATORICS, 13(1), -</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1077-8926</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5906</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5906</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
