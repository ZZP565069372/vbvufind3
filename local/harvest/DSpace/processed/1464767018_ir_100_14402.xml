These spillways are designed for dual purpose of flood disposal as well as flushing of sediment. The spillways are located as near the river bed as possible so as to flush the sediment. Due to this the head over the spillway crest is of the order of 30â€“40 m. In exceptional cases the head increases to about 60 to 80 m. The spillway crest profile becomes very flat as compared to overflow spillways. High negative pressures leading to cavitation damage is the main concern. Design of aeration groove for orifice spillways is a grey area and needs considerable research. This paper highlights the need for aerator, design considerations, present practices and their limitations. Sample calculations along with model results are included for illustration.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Indian Society for Hydraulics</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-09-12T11:02:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-09-12T11:02:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ISH Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, 14(1) 28-40</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>2164-3040</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14402</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
