All the complexes were found to be mononuclear, possessing the VO2+ moiety, These are shown to be hydrolytically and oxidatively stable over a wide range of pH (1-12) and have been extensively characterized by absorption and EPR spectroscopy and by electrochemistry, Several correlations have been drawn from the data generated. Some of these complexes have been demonstrated to possess in vitro RNase inhibition activity with no effect on DNase. This suggests that these molecules closely mimic the substrate portion of the RNase-catalysed RNA hydrolysis and can act as transition-state analogues to RNase.
