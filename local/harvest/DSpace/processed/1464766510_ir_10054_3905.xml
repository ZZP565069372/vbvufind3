The 08 band for the SI So electronic transition of 2PBI was observed at 31 616 cm(-1), and corresponding transitions for the H(2)O and MeOH complexes show substantial red shifts of 1059 and 1203 cm(-1), respectively. A long progression up to v' = 5 in the 92 cm(-1) vibrational mode was observed for bare 2PBI, which is considerably shortened to v' = 2 and v' = I for the H(2)O and MeOH complexes, respectively. The combined experimental and theoretical results suggest that both H(2)O and MeOH form cyclic complex with 2PBI incorporating N-H center dot center dot center dot O and O-H center dot center dot center dot N hydrogen bonds. Comparison with other known hydrogen-bonded H(2)O complexes of bifunctional aza-heteroaromatic molecules suggest that 2PBI-H(2)O is probably one of the strongest of all known complexes. Further, the experimental data in combination with calculations suggests that the hydrogen atom/proton transfer leading to tautomeric form might be thermodynamically spontaneous in the electronic excited state, due to explicit solvent (H(2)O and MeOH) participation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-14T08:08:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-14T08:08:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A, 114(32), 8323-8330</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1089-5639</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp104952v</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/3905</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/3905</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
