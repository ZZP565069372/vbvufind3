Isostructural compounds 1-4 have been characterized by analytical and spectroscopic methods and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements further reveal that compounds 1-3 (all C2/c) and 4 (P (1) over bar) are linear 1D coordination polymers. The uncoordinated 4,4'-azobipyridine in the lattice is responsible for the conversion of these 1D coordination polymers into 3D supramolecular assemblies through O-H center dot center dot center dot N hydrogen bonding interactions between coordinated water and N-centers of an azopy ligand. Similar reactions carried out using 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)-ethylene (bpe) as the linker yielded compounds having the formula {[M(dtbp)(2)(bpe)(H2O)(2)]center dot(bpe)}(x) (M = Mn (5); Co (6); Cu (7); Ni (8)). Compounds 5-8 have been characterized by analytical and spectroscopic methods. Preliminary single crystal X-ray diffraction studies carried out on poorly diffracting crystals of 5 and 6 establish their isostructural nature to 1-4, also displaying a similar supramolecular aggregation behaviour. A longer ditopic N, N'-donor ligand, 1,2-bis(pyridin-3-ylmethylene) hydrazine (bph), has been used in place of bpe/azoby to synthesize 1-dimensional coordination polymers [{M(bph)(H2O)(4)}{(dtbp)(2)}] (M = Ni (9) and M = Co (10)) and [Cd(bph)(3)(dtbp)(2)](n) (11) which have completely different structural motifs when compared to 1-4.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CHINESE CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:56:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:56:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS, 2(1)55-66</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>2052-1553</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4qi00149d</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17987</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
