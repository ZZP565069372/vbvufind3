Thus automatic raga recognition is a fundamental step in the computational modelling of the Indian art-music traditions. In this work, we investigate the properties of raga and the natural processes by which people identify it. We bring together and discuss the previous computational approaches to raga recognition correlating them with human techniques, in both Kar?a?aka (south Indian) and Hindustani (north Indian) music traditions. The approaches which are based on first-order pitch distributions are further evaluated on a large comprehensive dataset to understand their merits and limitations. We outline the possible short and mid-term future directions in this line of work.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T06:26:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T06:26:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF NEW MUSIC RESEARCH, 41(4)337-350</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09298215.2012.735246</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15429</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
