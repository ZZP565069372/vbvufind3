We extract the shape feature by computing the morphological pattern spectrum (MPS) for various structuring elements. The spatial relation among the disjoint components in the logo image is described by defining a simple and computationally inexpensive spatial relation graph (SRG). The SRG is obtained by joining the centroids of the two largest components with the centroids of the rest of the components. For retrieval purposes, the similarity measure is defined with respect to similarities in both shape and spatial relationship (MPS and SRG), The joint shape and spatial relation features enable us to obtain a very good precision rate. A relevance feedback mechanism is used to obtain the weights for various components in the similarity measure. The details of the method as well as results of experimentations are presented.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INST ELECTRONICS TELECOMMUNICATION ENGINEERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-03T05:57:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-03T05:57:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH, 51(5), 339-351</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0377-2063</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8918</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8918</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
