The crystal structure of 2(.)2H(2)O reveals an intricate hydrogen-bonding network: Two symmetry-related molecules 2 are closely connected through two NH(H2L2-)O-...- (acac-) interactions, while the oxygen atoms of H2L2- of two such pairs are bridged by an (H2O)(1) cluster at half-occupancy. The cluster consists of cyclic (H2O)(6) arrangements with the remaining two exo-H2O molecules connecting two opposite sides of the cyclo-(H2O)(6) cluster, and oxido oxygen atoms forming hydrogen bonds with the molecules of 2. Weak antiferromagnetic coupling of the two ruthenium(ill) centers in 2 was established by using SQUID magnetometry and EPR spectroscopy. Geometry optimization by means of DFT calculations was carried out for 1(2+) and 2 in their singlet and triplet ground states, respectively. The nature of low-energy electronic transitions was explored by using time-dependent DFT methods. Five redox states were reversibly accessible for each of the complexes; all odd-electron intermediates exhibit comproportionation constants K-c &gt; 10(8). UV-visible-NIR spectroelectrochemistry and EPR spectroscopy of the electrogenerated paramagnetic intermediates were used to ascertain the oxidation-state distribution. In general, the complexes 1(n+) prefer the ruthenium(ii) configuration with electron transfer occurring largely at the bridging ligand (mu-H2Ln-), as evident from radical-type EPR spectra for 1(3+) and 1(+). Higher metal oxidation states (111, iv) appear to be favored by the complexes 2(m); intense long-wavelength absorption bands and Ru-III-type EPR signals suggest mixed-valent dimetal configurations of the paramagnetic intermediates 2(+) and 2(-).</dc:description><dc:publisher>WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-12T12:15:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-12T12:15:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Review</dc:type><dc:identifier>CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL,11(17)4901-4911</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0947-6539</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chem.200500202</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/13767</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/3002</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
