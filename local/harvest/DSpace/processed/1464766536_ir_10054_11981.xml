Centers and medians are especially important in distributed systems because they are ideal locations for placing resources that need to be shared among different processes in a network. This paper presents simple self-stabilizing algorithms for locating centers and medians of trees. Since these algorithms are self-stabilizing, they can tolerate transient failures. In addition, they can automatically adjust to a dynamically changing tree topology. After the algorithms are presented, their correctness is proven and upper bounds on their time complexity are established. Finally, extensions of our algorithms to trees with arbitrary, positive edge costs are sketched.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SIAM PUBLICATIONS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T05:44:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T05:44:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING, 29(2), 600-614</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0097-5397</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/S0097539798427156</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11981</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11981</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
