Compressive split Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus was used for the studies. Two loading cases, namely, specimen not failed and specimen failed during loading are investigated. The special characteristics of specimen not failed case are presented. For this case, the specimens are under compressive strain initially and are under tensile strain during the later part of loading. The induced tensile strain is higher than the induced compressive strain. This could lead to failure of specimen/structure under tensile strain even though the applied load is compressive.
