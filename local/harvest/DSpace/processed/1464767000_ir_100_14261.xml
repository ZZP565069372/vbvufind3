Current-induced breakdown caused by Joule heating has been achieved by applying suitably high voltages. The broken tubes were examined and exposed to electrons of 3-10 keV in situ in SEM with careful maneuvering of the electron beam at the broken site, which results In the mechanical joining of the tube. Electrical recovery of the same tube has been confirmed by performing the current-voltage measurements after joining. This easy approach is directly applicable for the repairing of carbon nanotubes incorporated In ready devices, such as in on chip horizontal interconnects or on tip probing applications, such as in scanning tunneling microscopy.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-06-26T09:08:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-06-26T09:08:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ACS NANO,5(3)1724-1730</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1936-0851</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn102288u</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14261</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
