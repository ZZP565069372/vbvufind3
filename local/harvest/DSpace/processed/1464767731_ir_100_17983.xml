Isomorphous organophosphates 1-3 form a tubular structure in the solid state through extensive hydrogen bonding interactions between adjacent -PO3H2 groups, an aggregation previously unknown among organophosphates and phosphonic acids. The methyl ester of 2, [(RO)P(O)(OMe)(2)] (R = 4-Br-2,6-(Pr2C6H3)-Pr-i) (4), was reacted with a series of boronic acids under Suzuki coupling conditions to yield the corresponding C-C bond coupled products, 3,5-diisopropylbiphenyl-4-yl dimethyl phosphate (5), 4'-formyl-3,5-diisopropylbiphenyl-4-yl dimethyl phosphate (6) and 4'-(diphenylmethyleneamino)-3,3',5,5'-tetraisopropylbiphenyl-4-yl dimethyl phosphate (7). The possible reaction conditions for the selective deprotection of phosphate triesters have been established, under which 6 yields 4'-formyl-3,5-diisopropyl-biphenyl-4-yl dihydrogenphosphate (8). Compound 8 is a formyl group functionalized phosphate and shows hydrogen bonding similar to 1-3 forming tubular channels surrounded by peripheral organic groups. The dangling formyl groups in phosphates 6 and 8 undergo intermolecular tail-to-tail hydrogen bonding forming 1-dimensional assemblies in the former and 3-dimensional supramolecules in the latter. Amino and formyl functionalized phosphates may serve as ideal primary building units for building suitably functionalized metal phosphate secondary building units.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:54:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:54:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY, 39(2)1186-1195</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1144-0546</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1369-9261</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4nj01614a</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17983</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
