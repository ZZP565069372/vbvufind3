Kinetic parameters were determined from the TG curves by using two model-free methods, i.e. Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS). The activation energy (E) for the decomposition of (NH(4))(3)Y(2)F(9) was dependent on the fraction converted, alpha; its value was 152 kJ/mol (for alpha = 0.1-0.3) and 232 kJ/mol (for alpha = 0.4-0.8) from both models; and the pre-exponential factor (ln(A)) was 43 (for alpha = 0.1-0.3) and 59 (for alpha = 0.4-0.8). For the decomposition of NH(4)Y(2)F(7), the activation energy (E) was independent of the fraction converted, alpha, and its value was 123 kJ/mol; the pre-exponential factor (ln(A)) was 31. The decomposition of (NH(4))(3)Y(2)F(9) proceeds by one-dimensional diffusion (for alpha = 0.1-0.3), followed by two-dimensional diffusion (for alpha = 0.4-0.8). The decomposition of NH(4)Y(2)F(7) occurs by random nucleation and growth.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-06-26T05:55:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-06-26T05:55:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>REACTION KINETICS MECHANISMS AND CATALYSIS,103(1)53-70</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1878-5190</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11144-011-0287-2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/13982</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
