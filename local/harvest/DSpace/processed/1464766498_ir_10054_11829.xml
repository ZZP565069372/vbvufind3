The presence of the free hydroxyl group makes ProDOT-OH as the material of choice due to ease of derivatization. This has been shown successfully for pre-polymerization functionalization wherein various derivatives were synthesized starting from ProDOT-OH. All the monomers were characterized by H-1, C-13 NMR, GC-MS and elemental analysis. The polymers were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, spectroelectrochemistry and in situ conductance measurements.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-28T19:54:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-28T19:54:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY, 14(12), 1896-1900</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0959-9428</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b404600e</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11829</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11829</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
