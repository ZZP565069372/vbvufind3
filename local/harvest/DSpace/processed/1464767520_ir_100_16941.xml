The longitudinal samples are found to show lower flow stress than that shown by the transverse samples in the temperature range of 25200 degrees C. The reverse becomes true at higher temperatures of 300-500 degrees C. The values of stress exponent (n) and activation energy for deformation (Q), based on applied stress, ranged from 10 to 46 and 307416 kJ/mol, respectively. However, by considering effective stress, these values were reduced to n = 8 and Q = 126-190 kJ/mol. This stress exponent ofn = 8 is further reduced to n = 5 by considering substructural evolution, which suggests the dislocation climb creep mechanism to be favorable for deformation.
