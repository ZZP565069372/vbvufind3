Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) from the acidogenic fungus Aspergillus niger was purified from GABA grown mycelia to the highest specific activity of 277 nmol min(-1) mg(-1), using phenyl Sepharose and DEAE Sephacel chromatography. The purified enzyme was specific for its substrates SSA and NAD(+). The substrate inhibition observed with SSA was uncompetitive with respect to NAD(+). While product inhibition by succinate was not observed, NADH inhibited the enzyme competitively with respect to NAD(+) and noncompetitively with respect to SSA. Dead-end inhibition by AMP and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (pHB) was analyzed. The pHB inhibition was competitive with SSA and uncompetitive with NAD(+); AMP competed with NAD(+). Consistent with the kinetic data, a sequential, ordered Bi Bi mechanism is proposed for this enzyme.</dc:description><dc:publisher>NATL INST SCIENCE COMMUNICATION-NISCAIR</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T10:50:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T10:50:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY, 53(2)67-74</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0019-5189</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0975-1009</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/18391</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
