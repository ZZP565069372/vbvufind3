Silica-insulin nanocomposite (SINC) and ferrite-coated SINC (FeSINC) was prepared by polyelectrolytic condensation of silica precursor on insulin and they were studied for their ability to control glucose levels. SINC was prepared by acid-base-catalyzed polymerization in the presence Of insulin at room temperature by a modified Stober's process. FeSINC nanoparticles were prepared by coprecipitation of both ferric and ferrous salts on the bovine bovine insulin loaded silica nanoparticle. The presence of ferrite coating in FeSINC was identified using a vibrating sample magnetometer and quantified from XRF study. The intermolecular interactions in these nanocomposites were studied by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. All in vivo study indicated that FeSINC was biologically active in reducing glucose levels as compared to SINC.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-14T03:59:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-14T03:59:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>LANGMUIR, 26(1), 357-361</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0743-7463</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la902094c</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/3854</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/3854</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
