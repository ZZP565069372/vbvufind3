Deformed microstructures had two interesting features- deformation twins and strain induced martensite. The former originated from decay of prior annealing twins as well as through formation of new deformation twins. Strain induced martensite formation was strongly affected by the strain and strain path. This was generalized in terms of frequency and size advantage - a classification based purely on martensite grain size. The frequency advantage was related to the presence of microstructural heterogeneities, while the growth advantage appears to originate from relative tolerance around 45 degrees &lt; 001 &gt; Bain orientation relationship.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CERAMIC SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-22T21:20:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-22T21:20:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>MATERIALS PROCESSING AND TEXTURE,200,257-263</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-0-470-44419-1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1042-1122</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/14983</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/1679</dc:identifier><dc:source>15th International Conference on Textures of Materials,Pittsburgh, PA,JUN 01-06, 2008</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
