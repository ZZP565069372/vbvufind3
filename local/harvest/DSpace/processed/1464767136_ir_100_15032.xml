Capturing non-intersection of half-line makes the supply rate system-dependent: a novel feature unobserved in the supply rates considered in the literature so far. We then show that the traditional finite and positive gain/phase margin conditions for stability are equivalent to dissipativity with respect to a frequency weighted convex combination of the not-out-of-phase supply rate and the small-gain supply rate; both frequency weightings and combining two supply-rates/performance-indices have been investigated in the literature in different contexts, but only as sufficient conditions.
