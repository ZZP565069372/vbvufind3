Experiments show that undoped and Ag-doped films grown at 200 mTorr oxygen pressure and quenched immediately after termination of growth have a superconducting transition temperature T(c) of 61 and 86 K, respectively. The high T(c) of 86 K obtained with quenched Ag-doped films is thought to be due to both enhanced oxygen incorporation and reduced deoxygenation associated with Ag doping. These results show that Ag-doped YBa2Cu3O7-x films could be crucial for realizing devices based on multilayer structures.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER INST PHYSICS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-10T13:59:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:08:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-10T13:59:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:08:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>1994</dc:date><dc:type>Note</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS,76(2)1349-1351</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0021-8979</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.357802</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/13090</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/674</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
