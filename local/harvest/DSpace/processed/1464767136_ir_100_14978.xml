It was found that as the horizontal well length increases, the breakthrough oil recovery rises and then falls indicating an optimum well length. The effect of reservoir properties, such as permeability, bottom water thickness, reservoir thickness, and viscosity of oil, and operating conditions, such as injection rate and injection well length, on breakthrough oil recovery were studied and explained on the basis of approach of interface between swept and un-swept zones to the production well.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T13:14:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T13:14:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS, 35(24)2337-2347</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1556-7036</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1556-7230</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15567036.2010.533338</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14978</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
