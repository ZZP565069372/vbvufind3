In general, the frequency of the system is controlled by employing a dump load whose rating is equal to the rated power output of the plant. The proposed scheme reduces the size of the dump load to 50%, as 50% input power of the hydro plant is controlled by an on/off control. A generalized transfer function model for the system is developed with on/off control logic, and the parameters were optimized using the integral time absolute error technique. The on/off control linearly raises or lowers the generation. Finally, transient responses are shown for low, medium, and high head installations with different loading conditions.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-06-26T10:00:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-06-26T10:00:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS,39(1)46-63</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1532-5008</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15325008.2010.513362</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14352</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
