SAXS measurement was analyzed by Guiner plot, Porod plot, Debye plot and scaling factor. The measurement of the SAXS results assumed a distribution of spherical pores. This analysis suggested that the maximum of pore size distributions occur for radius of gyration of 5-6 angstrom. As the H-2 flow rate increases, the pore size distribution narrows and the volume occupied by the pores decreases. A direct relation between the atomic density of a-SiC:H films deposited by HWCVD and the pore volume fraction was also obtained. The low scattering intensity observed for the films deposited by HWCVD showed that they were compact and homogeneous regardless of the H-2 dilution.
