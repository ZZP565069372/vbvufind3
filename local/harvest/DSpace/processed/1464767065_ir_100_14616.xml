X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that no secondary phase appeared even if Bi atoms were substituted with Sm atoms up to 10 at. %. 7.5 at. % Sm-substituted films show improved electrical properties and substitution was effective in improving the coercive field in the films. Sm-substitution shows improved ferroelectric as well as magnetic properties of the films. There is a noticeable reduction in the leakage current density (10(-4) A/cm(2)) and increase in the polarization (70 mu C/cm(2)) when the Sm concentration is kept around 7.5%. The magnetic moment obtained from the saturated magnetization curves shows a value of 0.3 mu(B)/Fe compared to 0.04 mu(B)/Fe for the parent compound. The results are important since it increases the potential of the material as a multiferroic compound. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.
