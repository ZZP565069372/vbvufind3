Various types of thermomechanical treatments were carried out on the modified 9Cr-1Mo steel, and the nature of grain boundaries was evaluated using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD); the "effective grain boundary energy" (EGBE) was also computed. The minimum EGBE was obtained in a specimen that was deformed in the austenite phase field at 1323 K and further normalized and tempered. This condition also gave a high fraction of coincident site lattice boundaries compared to the normalized and tempered modified 9Cr-1Mo steel.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T12:20:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T12:20:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE, 40A(9), 2030-2032</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1073-5623</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11661-009-9932-z</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12080</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12080</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
