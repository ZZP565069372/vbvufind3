The films consist of spongy particle aggregates with uniform pores at the surface. Structural features and surface morphology were studied by XRD and SEM analyses. These films have been found to decompose aqueous solutions of phenol, chlorophenol, naphthalene and anthracene to CO- quite efficiently. Concentrations decreased linearly with illumination time, and high rate constants were obtained for the degradation of these organics. The pH values of the solution changed with the irradiation time due to the formation of hydroxylated intermediate photoproducts which have been detected in many cases.
