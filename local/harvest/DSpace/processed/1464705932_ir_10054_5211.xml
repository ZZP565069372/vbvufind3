The paper presents the results of an anthropometric survey conducted on schoolchildren. These data, previously lacking in India, can be of benefit for the designers of kindergartens. A set of 81 different body dimensions was taken from a sample of 198 children of age group 3-4 years and 4.1-5 years. Simple anthropometric techniques were used to collect the data. Statistical analyses of the data have been presented in a tabular form for designers as well as for non-technical users. It is emphasized that such data have to be developed at the national level, including every ethnic group, or on a regional basis. Designers, manufacturers and importers of goods should have access to these data.</dc:description><dc:publisher>BUTTERWORTH-HEINEMANN LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-19T07:19:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-19T07:19:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>1995</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>APPLIED ERGONOMICS, 26(1), 67-72</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0003-6870</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0003-6870(94)00002-G</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5211</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5211</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
