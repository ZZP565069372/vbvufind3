It modulates astrocyte activation by inhibiting the enhanced astrocytic synthesis of S-100 beta protein, responsible for inducing neuronal death. The phase II clinical trials for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, as well as clinical development in other neurodegenerative diseases including amytrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are recently completed. There is no review published in this area since its discovery as potential neuroprotective agent and the various syntheses reported for this important non-natural compound. This review summarizes the studies towards the development of arundic acid as a neuroprotective agent, the biological studies in vitro and in vivo, the phase II trials and the various efforts made for its synthesis in the last two decades.</dc:description><dc:publisher>BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T14:05:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T14:05:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY, 20(18)2315-2329</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15740</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
