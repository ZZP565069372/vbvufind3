The aim of the system is to overcome some of the limitations inherent in Micro-IDBMS, a microcomputer-based image database management system. These limitations include abrupt failure and the inability to capture the concept of an image. Abrupt failure may occur during retrieval when there are no images that have the specified attribute value. The inability to capture the concept of an image is related to the general idea that an image is a representation. KIMS basically consists of an image knowledge base and an inference mechanism, in addition to Micro-IDBMS. The paper describes the role of image knowledge and presents the design and implementation details of KIMS.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-25T10:24:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-25T10:24:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>1991</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS, 4(4), 209-214</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0950-7051</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/6712</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/6712</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
