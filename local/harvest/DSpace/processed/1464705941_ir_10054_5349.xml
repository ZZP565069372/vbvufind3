The grain size increases with increase in strain and temperature. Upon deformation to a fixed strain, the grain growth is generally seen to be more at lower strain rates. The rates of overall grain growth (d-epsilon,t) and due to deformation alone (d-epsilon), however, increase with increasing strain rate according to d-epsilon,t is proportional to epsilon-0.86 and d-epsilon is proportional to-0.64, respectively. The increase in the grain growth rate with strain rate is attributed primarily to the shorter time involved at higher strain rate for reaching a fixed strain. The activation energy for grain growth under superplastic conditions is estimated to be 79 kJ mol-1.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CHAPMAN HALL LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-19T15:47:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-19T15:47:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>1991</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE, 26(17), 4657-4662</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-2461</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00612402</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5349</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5349</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
