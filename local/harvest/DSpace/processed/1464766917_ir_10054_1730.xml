The report identifies 27 services as “basic banking services” of banks in India. The report indicates difficulties in measuring reasonability of bank charges and states that such measurement studies are not feasible within Reserve Bank and that an outside institution may be commissioned to carry out the study. The present paper attempts to look into the issue and provide a detailed analysis of the service charges of banks in India.</dc:description><dc:date>2010-03-30T15:25:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-01-02T05:08:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-03-30T15:25:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-01-02T05:08:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-03-30T15:25:38Z</dc:date><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1730</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/10054/1730</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
