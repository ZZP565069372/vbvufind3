FRPs, MMCs and CMCs will be widely used in all the engineering applications (aerospace, automobile, consumer durables, etc.). In a competitive world, the ability to design a composite and manufacture products of acceptable quality at reasonable prices is going to be a major challenge to all manufacturing organizations. I.I.T. Bombay is actively engaged in the development of composites and processing them. FRP is primarily processed in the Department of Aerospace Engineering; whereas, MMCs and CMCs are developed in the Department of Metallurgical Engineering and Material Science. Machining operations and their evaluations are carried out in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. This paper present some of the work carried out during the last seven to eight years, with emphasis on machining and cutting tool development.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MINERALS, METALS &amp; MATERIALS SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T14:19:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T14:19:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>PROCESSING AND FABRICATION OF ADVANCED MATERIALS V,81-89</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-87339-349-X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16322</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2822</dc:identifier><dc:source>Symposium on Processing and Fabrication of Advanced Materials V, at Materials Meet 96,CINCINNATI, OH,OCT 06-10, 1996</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
