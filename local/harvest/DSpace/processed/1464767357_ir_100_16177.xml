The passive films were characterized by glow discharge-quadrupole mass spectroscopy (GD-QMS) for compositional variation across the depth and micro laser Raman spectroscopy for oxide composition on the surface. The defect density in the oxide films was established from the Mott-Schottky analysis using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Electrochemical experiments at room temperature in chloride medium revealed best passivity behaviour by the oxide film formed at 300 degrees C for 72 h. The electrochemical studies were correlated to the chromium (and oxygen) content of the oxide films. Autoclaving at 300 degrees C resulted in the best passive film formation on Alloy 690 in lithiated water. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
