importance in nuclear engineering. The mechanical behavior of concrete at high temperature is non-linear. The
properties that regulate its response are highly temperature dependent and extremely complex. In addition, the
constituent materials, e.g. aggregates, influence the response significantly. Attempts have been made to trace the
stress–strain curve through mathematical models and rheological models. However, it has been difficult to include all
the contributing factors in the mathematical model. This paper examines a new programming paradigm, artificial
neural networks, for the problem. Implementing a feedforward network and backpropagation algorithm the
stress–strain relationship of the material is captured. The neural networks for the prediction of uniaxial behavior of
concrete at high temperature has been presented here. The results of the present investigation are very encouraging.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-04-28T05:24:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-08T06:36:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:01:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:46:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-04-28T05:24:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-08T06:36:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:01:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:46:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Nuclear Engineering and Design 178(1), 1-11</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0029-5493</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1016/S0029-5493(97)00152-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1252</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1252</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
