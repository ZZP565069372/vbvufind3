The two multi-expanded porphyrin assemblies were soluble in common organic solvents, and their identities were confirmed by their corresponding molecular ion peak in the MALDI-TOF mass spectra. 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques were used to deduce the molecular structures of the mult-expanded porphyrin assemblies. Absorption spectral studies showed that the band positions of the multi-sapphyrin assemblies were similar to that of the monomeric sapphyrin, but the extinction coefficients were three-to fourfold higher than that of the monomeric sapphyrin. The multisapphyrin assemblies are not very stable under redox conditions.</dc:description><dc:publisher>WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-14T10:38:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-14T10:38:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY(14)3157-3163</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1434-193X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1099-0690</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejoc.201500131</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17380</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
