This results invariably in the children continuing with the traditional nomadic culture. Maharashtra, a state in western India shares borders with a number of neighbouring states. The nomadic tribes in this state, therefore, invariably wander amongst the neighbouring states. This paper is a report on an exciting experiment with convergence of tradition and ICT. The author and his team have studied the tribes in detail and have evolved a methodology that involves the use of all available technologies, based on relevance, availability, portability, repeatability and flexibility. The initial experiments carried out with three tribes in Maharashtra, have created the much needed motivation in the children and mothers and given the assurance that the efforts will bear fruit.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-25T11:40:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-25T11:40:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE REGION 10 CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-5,2030-2034</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-0-7803-9311-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0886-1420</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15709</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2348</dc:identifier><dc:source>IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON 2005),Melbourne, AUSTRALIA,NOV 21-24, 2005</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
