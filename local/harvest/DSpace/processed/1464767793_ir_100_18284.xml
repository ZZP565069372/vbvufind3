Enhancements of up to 165% in the mass transfer coefficients were observed at fairly low volume fractions of the particles. A model which accounts for the effect of particles in terms of a superimposed convection has been proposed to explain the observed effects of particle size, hold-up, and material density. The model provides a good fit to the data from wetted wall column and capillary tube experiment for Fe3O4 from the previous literature, as well as for the data from this work.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ASME</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T09:44:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T09:44:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME, 137(9SI)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-1481</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1528-8943</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4030219</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/18284</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
