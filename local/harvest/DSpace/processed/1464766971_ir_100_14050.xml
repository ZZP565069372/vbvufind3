The specimens were irradiated to 0.43 and 0.86 dpa. Microstructural observation after EPR of irradiated specimens showed negligible attack on grain boundaries. Attacked linear features were noticed after EPR testing of irradiated specimens while such features were not observed for un-irradiated as-received or irradiated solution-annealed specimen. The presence of linear features after EPR testing of irradiated specimens was attributed to decoration of strain-regions within the matrix by point-defects generated due to irradiation.
