It is thus imperative to have an instrument to assess the manufacturing capability of companies. However, empirically tested and reliable tools for the purpose of evaluation of manufacturing capability along different decision areas are scarcely available in the literature. This paper develops questionnaires based on generally accepted principle of instrument design to assess the manufacturing capabilities along different decision areas for four categorization schemes of manufacturing decision areas reported in the literature. The reliability and validity of all four instruments are assessed through responses from managers of 32 manufacturing units and are found to be satisfactory for most of the factors. The criterion validity is found to be fairly good for all the four instruments.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER LONDON LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-28T11:49:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-28T11:49:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY, 71(9/12)2091-2105</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0268-3768</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1433-3015</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00170-013-5589-2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/16402</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
