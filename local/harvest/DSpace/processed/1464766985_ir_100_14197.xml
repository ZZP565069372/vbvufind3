Optimum performance was observed with the membrane having I-PVC-TBAB-DBP in the ratio 1:33:1:65 (w/w). The electrode has a linear response to nitrate with a detection limit of 3.9 x 10(-5) +/- 0.07 M and Nernstian compliance (57.0 +/- 0.2 mV/decade) between pH 2.8 and 9.6 with a fast response time of about 20s. The selectivity coefficient values of the order of 0.001 for mono-; bi- and trivalent anions; indicate high selectivity for nitrate ions over these anions. The preparation procedure of the electrode is very easy and inexpensive. The electrodes were used over a period of 45 days with good reproducibility. The analytical usefulness of the proposed electrode has been evaluated by its application in the determination of nitrate ions in waste water samples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
