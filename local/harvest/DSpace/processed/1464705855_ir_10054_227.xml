For these applications, the primary requirement is that the TFTs have a low threshold voltage, low and stable leakage current and reasonably high carrier mobility. The poly-Si TFTs typically have sufficiently large mobilities to be used for high-drive and moderately high-frequency applications. However, since low temperatures are used in poly-Si TFT fabrication, both semiconducting and insulating layers are of poorer quality than those used in crystalline-Si technology. Consequently, long term TFT stability is an important issue. A considerable amount of research has focused on the stability of poly-Si TFTs. The instabilities are basically associated with hot carrier injection and degradation, negative gate bias instability and gate-induced carrier injection and trapping (Young, 1996). This leads to degradation of several device parameters such as threshold voltage, mobility, transconductance, and subthreshold slope. The work presented here is a comprehensive study of degradation in low temperature (&amp;les;600Â°C) poly-Si TFTs due to high-field, hot-carrier and ionizing radiation stressing. This unified approach makes it possible to identify the key reasons for degradation. Furthermore, a systematic study of the dependence on device geometry, as reported here, also helps understanding of the degradation mechanisms.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-12-08T08:39:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-27T11:36:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:56:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-12-08T08:39:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-27T11:36:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:56:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits, Singapore, 9-13 July 2001, 258-262</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-6675-1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1109/IPFA.2001.941498</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/227</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/227</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
