Chromate conversion coatings are well known pre-treatment coatings for steel but due to environmental concerns and legislations, their use has been restricted. The industrial community, pegged by these legislations, has been long demanding an economically viable and eco-friendly pre-treatment coating alternative, without having to compromise on the durability and corrosion performance of the overall coating system. The present study focuses on evaluation of graphene as an anticorrosive alternative to Cr(VI) based coatings. Graphene, produced by a high shear liquid exfoliation route, upon functionalisation, provides a conductive and nearly impermeable barrier coating. On electrochemical and coating performance evaluation of this coating system, a dramatic improvement in corrosion resistance is observed. The study confirms the environment friendly corrosion protection of steel using functionalised graphene coating.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T07:14:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T07:14:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>NANOSCALE, 7(42)17879-17888</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>2040-3364</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>2040-3372</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5nr04702a</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/18023</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
