The recovery values obtained in electroflotation were compared keeping the bubble surface area in one case and the bubble flux in the other case constant in both electro and conventional flotation. In electrolytic flotation, hydrogen bubbles were generated at stainless steel plate cathode under different current densities. In conventional flotation, high purity cylinder nitrogen gas was passed through sintered frits of differing porosity. A video camera system was used to measure the bubble sizes generated under various experimental conditions. The results reveal that bubble size and bubble flux play a vital role in determining the flotation recovery.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INDIAN INST METALS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-02T13:18:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-02T13:18:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>TRANSACTIONS OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF METALS, 50(5), 377-381</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0019-493X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8809</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8809</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
