The devices are based on Mn doped HfO2 material. The mechanism behind reconfiguration was studied and a unified model is presented to explain the underlying device physics. The model was then utilized to show the application of these devices in speech recognition. A comparison between a 20 nm x 20 nm sized synaptic memory device with that of a state-of-the-art VLSI SRAM synapse showed similar to 10x reduction in area and &gt;10(6) times reduction in the power consumption per learning cycle.</dc:description><dc:publisher>NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-29T05:58:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-29T05:58:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>SCIENTIFIC REPORTS, 4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>2045-2322</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep05333</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17253</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
