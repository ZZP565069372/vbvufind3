A Shockley-Read-Hall-type model has been used to model trapping and detrapping of protons at these sites which behave as traps with two levels. A small signal equivalent circuit is obtained. The model has been validated with extensive imittance measurements on electrolyte-oxide-semiconductor structures. From the conductance frequency measurements, the response time of these traps is of the order of a few milliseconds which would also be the intrinsic response time of ion sensitive field effect transistor. The approach is quite general and could be used for studying trapping-detrapping of ions or charged molecules at other electrolyte-insulator interfaces.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELECTROCHEMICAL SOC INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-21T15:02:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-21T15:02:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>1992</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY, 139(6), 1706-1714</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0013-4651</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1149/1.2069481</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5901</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5901</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
