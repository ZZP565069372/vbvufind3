On the whole, India has made significant efforts for the successful utilization of solar energy. A large number of kilowatt scale PV power packs and systems for a variety of applications have been installed. Successful attempts have also been made to integrate a few PV systems with the grid. As regards the thermal route, the experience of generating electricity has been limited. However, ambitious plans are afoot for setting up a few large power plants in western Rajasthan where the conditions are most appropriate for the utilization of solar energy.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CURRENT SCIENCE ASSN</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-21T07:29:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-21T07:29:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>CURRENT SCIENCE, 72(1), 62-68</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0011-3891</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5828</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5828</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
