Therefore, devices were subjected to neutron radiation in a swimming pool type of reactor and other samples from the same batch were exposed to an equivalent accompanying gamma radiation using a Co-60 source. The difference in the damage observed was used to characterize the damage due to neutrons alone. It is observed that neutrons, even though uncharged, are capable of causing ionisation damage in the gate oxide which is significant when the radiation is performed under biased conditions. It is believed that neutron induced ionization damage is essentially due to secondary process of recoils.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-23T22:35:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-23T22:35:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>PROCEEDINGS OF THE ELEVENTH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON THE PHYSICS OF SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES, VOL 1 &amp; 2,4746,733-736</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-8194-4500-2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0277-786X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15255</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/1951</dc:identifier><dc:source>11th International Workshop on the Physics of Semiconductor Devices,New Delhi, INDIA,DEC 11-15, 2001</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
