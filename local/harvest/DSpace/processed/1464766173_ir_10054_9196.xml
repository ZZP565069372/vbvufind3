Their visible light photocatalytic activity was investigated for the degradation of congo red (CR) dye. All NCs showed improved degradation as compared to the polycrystalline samples of similar compositions prepared by the solid-state reaction (SSR) route (average particle size of a few micrometers), as well as to the pure TiO(2). The better photocatalytic activity of the NCs was attributed to their smaller particle size. Another comparison of the results with those obtained with Zn(2+)/Fe(3+) ions co-doped TiO(2) NCs, under similar experimental conditions, revealed that in the Y(3+)-doped NCs, particle size might not be the only factor responsible for the improved photocatalytic properties. It was concluded that the Y(3+) ion-mediated suppression of the unwanted e(-)/h(+) recombination could be the possible factor leading to additional enhancement.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IOP PUBLISHING LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-04T01:15:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-04T01:15:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>NANOTECHNOLOGY, 20(25), -</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0957-4484</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0957-4484/20/25/255601</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9196</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9196</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
