In the present work it is shown that the vibration signal analysis can be effectively used for diagnosing the lubrication condition of gears. The spectral and statistical analysis of the gear vibration acceleration are investigated. Spectral analysis indicates that the deterioration in lubrication condition causes for overall increase in the amplitude of acceleration, but the relative increase in the amplitudes of higher harmonics of tooth meshing frequencies indicate the condition of lubrication. Difficulties in spectral analysis are also mentioned. In statistical analysis the probability density functions of the recorded time histories, along with their normal approximations are used. A goodness of fit parameter has been proposed for the normal approximation of the probability density function, which has been found to be a goad indicator of the lubrication condition.</dc:description><dc:publisher>A A BALKEMA PUBLISHERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T12:20:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T12:20:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>MODERN PRACTICE IN STRESS AND VIBRATION ANALYSIS,449-453</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>90-5410-896-7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16296</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2549</dc:identifier><dc:source>3rd International Conference on Modern Practice in Stress and Vibration Analysis,DUBLIN, IRELAND,SEP 03-05, 1997</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
