This is demonstrated in the literature for continuous processes. In this paper, a mathematical formulation is proposed to minimize the operating cost of water allocation network in a batch process by utilizing multiple freshwater resources. The proposed methodology incorporates the variable scheduling of a batch process, for a given production, and it is applicable to single as well as multicontaminant water allocation problems. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated with two illustrative examples. In these two examples, in comparison to single freshwater use, reductions of 17% and 32% in operating costs are observed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-29T05:37:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-29T05:37:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDUSTRIAL &amp; ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH, 53(14)5996-6005</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0888-5885</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie403638v</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17212</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
