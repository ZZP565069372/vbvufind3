In fact, it can be argued that many of the necessary building blocks for understanding of industrial systems are already here. However, there is still a mismatch between basic research and needs. This is not likely to be bridged: Basic research is divergent and long-term, whereas technological needs are convergent and tied to deadlines. It is however apparent that theoretical understanding is now considerably deeper, that involved simulations are now possible, and that new experimental techniques are opening new horizons. The assembly of all these methodologies, in due time, should open the mixing arts to serious engineering analysis and predictability.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-02-16T09:55:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T16:58:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:05:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:53:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-02-16T09:55:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T16:58:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:05:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:53:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Powder Technology 121(2-3), 117-122</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0032-5910</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0032-5910(01)00361-8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/656</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/656</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
