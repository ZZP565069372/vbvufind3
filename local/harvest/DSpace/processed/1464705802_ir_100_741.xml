The validity of the numerical solution is established by comparing it with the results of the Hele-Shaw analog model. A general relationship between saltwater toe movement, and different rates of linear rise in the surface source level, located at various distances from the coast, was established. The movement of the interface is also monitored after the rise in the surface source level is stopped. The results obtained from the studies are applicable to a wide range of practical cases and are useful in management schemes on the control of seawater intrusion in coastal areas.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-10T17:58:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:08:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-10T17:58:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:08:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>1995</dc:date><dc:type>Note</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING-ASCE,121(1)109-113</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0733-9437</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(1995)121:1(109)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/13149</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/741</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
