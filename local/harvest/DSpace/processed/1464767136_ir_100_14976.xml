The powders calcined at different temperatures showed apparent differences in the state of agglomeration. Besides the use of conventional techniques, such as Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), for observation of crystallite size and agglomeration in powders, the differences in state of agglomeration of the powders were examined through pressure-displacement behavior during powder compaction, nanoindentation of green powder compacts. The observations from load-displacement behavior were shown to be correlated to resistance to penetration of green compacts during nanoindentation as well as the green and sintered densities.
