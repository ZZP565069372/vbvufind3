All the monomers were characterized for their molecular structures, and the polymers were characterized for their electrochemical properties. The disubstituted derivatives showed higher contrast than the corresponding monoalkyl derivatives. The highest electrochromic contrast of 89% was exhibited by a dibenzyl derivative, but the derivative was insoluble. On the other hand, the electrochemically polymerized dihexyl- and didodecyl-substituted poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene)s exhibited 74 and 77% electrochromic contrast, respectively, and were soluble. The molecular weights of the chemically and electrochemically synthesized polymers were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography. The chemically synthesized polymers showed higher molecular weights.
