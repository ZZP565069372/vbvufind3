Studies on a series of curcumin analogues, synthesized to investigate their tubulin binding affinities and tubulin self-assembly inhibition, showed that: (i) curcumin acts as a bifunctional ligand, (ii) analogues with substitution at the diketone and acetylation of the terminal phenolic groups of curcumin are less effective, (iii) a benzylidiene derivative, compound 7, is more effective than curcumin in inhibiting tubulin self-assembly. Cell-based studies also showed compound 7 to be more effective than curcumin. Using fluorescence spectroscopy we show that curcumin binds tubulin 32 angstrom away from the colchicine-binding site. Docking studies also suggests that the curcumin-binding site to be close to the vinblastine-binding site. Structure-activity studies suggest that the tridented nature of compound 7 is responsible for its higher affinity for tubulin compared to curcumin.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-02-08T18:56:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-02-08T18:56:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY,54(18)6183-6196</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-2623</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jm2004046</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/13864</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
