Systematic characterisations of the structural developments were carried out. Bulk texture developments were gradual, strongest developments being noticed at the highest strain. Although formation of well defined deformation fibre(s) could not be identified, overall developments in deformation texture were best captured through Taylor type models incorporating only prismatic slip. Strain localisations were observed as single or double walled dislocation structures at approximately 45 and 60 degrees to the rolling direction. Such strain localisations were always associated with significant lattice reorientations or misorientation developments. Relative softening in lattice strain, observed at the higher reductions, can possibly be explained by the appearance of extensive strain localisations and the associated concurrent local dynamic recovery. The grains or orientations with dominant presence of strain localisations could be indirectly related to negative textural softening.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MANEY PUBLISHING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-17T13:07:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-17T13:07:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, 22(3), 331-342</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0267-0836</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/174328406X86074</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9878</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9878</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
