These emissions are contrasted against the background, to obtain the infrared signature levels. The infrared detector's - noise equivalent flux density, is proposed an operational constraint on the flight envelope. The shift of tills newly imposed constraint on the flight envelope for several engine-operating conditions, and for turbojet and turbofan engines is studied. The signature levels from the casing and plume, of a turbofan and equivalent turbojet engine, are compared at different operating paints on the flight envelope. Result in the form of a polar plot OF infrared signature level variation with aspect is also examined fur low flying missions. The results are analysed to direct stealth design and operation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL AERONAUTICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-27T11:18:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:57:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-27T11:18:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:57:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL, 105(1046), 185-192</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0001-9240</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11648</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11648</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
