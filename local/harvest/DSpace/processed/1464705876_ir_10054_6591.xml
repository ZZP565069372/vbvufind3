Using the concepts of information management, integration, system discipline, quick diagnosis, and simulation learning, a reengineering model was evolved with the help of SSAD, ORACLE7, Statgraphics and Fault Tree Analysis. This Reengineering model was implemented on the problem of nonmetallic inclusions in a large steel foundry committed to innovations. This pilot study was supported by production trials, the results of which were very significant. This paper discusses the details of this real-life experience.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-25T01:23:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-25T01:23:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS, 50(2-3), 225-243</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0925-5273</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0925-5273(97)00043-1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/6591</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/6591</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
