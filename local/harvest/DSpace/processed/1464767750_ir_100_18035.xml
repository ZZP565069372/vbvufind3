The effect of pH on Pb2+ binding was studied at pH = 5 in acetate buffer and pH = 7.2 in Tris buffer. Based on ITC, multiple binding sites were found for Pb2+ at pH = 7.2. No binding is noticed at pH = 5. The MD results showed the involvement of aspartate and glutamate with hemi-directed geometry for Pb2+. Pb2+ mediated beta sheet to alpha-helix transition was noticed at pH = 7.2. At physiological pH, morphological changes were observed in the reduction of size of the particles of LL (160 +/- 30 nm) to those in {LL + Pb2+} (45 +/- 10 nm) as derived based on AFM and TEM. In presence of Pb2+, the larger particles break down to smaller ones because of the coordination ability of Pb2+ towards carboxylate and imidazole moieties. At pH = 5, the TEM shows much higher aggregation than that observed at pH = 7.2 for the protein alone, leading to linear aggregated species which were further broken down by Pb2+ into smaller ones.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T07:20:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T07:20:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>RSC ADVANCES, 5(88)72352-72360</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>2046-2069</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra06427a</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/18035</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
