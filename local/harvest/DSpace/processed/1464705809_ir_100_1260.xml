Further, restrictions on the lower limit of the forgetting factor, used to prevent ill conditioning of the covariance matrix, confine applications of such techniques to slowly changing processes only. In this paper a modified blockwise dynamic recursive PLS technique that is based on selection of rich data has been proposed for online adaptation and control. Because of its ability to accommodate a wider range of forgetting factors, the technique is found to track the dynamics of slow as well as fast changes in the processes. The proposed technique has been evaluated for adaptation and control using representative chemical processes taken from the literature.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-19T16:08:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-19T16:08:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article; Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDUSTRIAL &amp; ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH,42(3)540-554</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0888-5885</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie020042r</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/14451</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/1260</dc:identifier><dc:source>6th IFAC Symposium on Dynamics and Control of Process Systems,JEJUDO ISLAND, SOUTH KOREA,</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
