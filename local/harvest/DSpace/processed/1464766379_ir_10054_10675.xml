Initially, one unit is put into operation (the switch is working at t = 0) and n - 1 units are kept as cold standbys. A failed unit is replaced by a standby if the switch and a standby are available. The server visits the system at random to check for the failed item and the check is instantaneous. When the system is down, either because of want of the standby or failure of the switch, the server is called for, and is assumed to arrive instantaneously. The revenue as well as the cost of repair are arbitrary functions of time. The expected net gain in (0, t) is evaluated assuming that all the life-time distributions are exponential and all the repair time distributions are arbitrary.</dc:description><dc:publisher>PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-23T22:46:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:56:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-23T22:46:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:56:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>1992</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MICROELECTRONICS AND RELIABILITY, 32(1-2), 5-9</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0026-2714</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0026-2714(92)90080-5</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10675</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10675</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
