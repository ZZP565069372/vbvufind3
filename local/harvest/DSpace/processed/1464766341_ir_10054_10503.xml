This method is very accurate, but requires very small time-steps and four equation solutions per time-step. These drawbacks hinder the solution of chaotic problems in multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems. This paper presents the solution of the chaotic problem of impacting single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) oscillators, using the Newmark method which is computationally efficient and unconditionally stable. The scheme incorporates an equilibrium iteration and variable time-stepping algorithm based on a convergence criteria which ensures that solution errors are minimized at each step. The results are compared with those obtained from the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. It is concluded that the Newmark method with an adequate check on the solution accuracy could give qualitatively the same results as the Runge-Kutta method. The method has the advantage of an extension to MDOF real-life problems of chaos which could be solved using numerical techniques like FEM with limited computing effort. Such an extension is being pursued separately.</dc:description><dc:publisher>PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-23T11:33:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:56:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-23T11:33:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:56:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>1993</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>COMPUTERS &amp; STRUCTURES, 49(4), 597-603</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0045-7949</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0045-7949(93)90064-K</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10503</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10503</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
