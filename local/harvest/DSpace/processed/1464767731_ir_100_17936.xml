The polyradicals are found to be stable with alternately periodic structure. They have high-spin ground states and show ferromagnetic interaction among all pairs of radical sites. The silicon sites are somewhat creased. A periodic calculation on the dimeric unit predicts the long-chain polyradical to be a one-dimensional ferromagnet. Band energy calculation gives a large gap between virtual and valence bands. The large energy gap owes its origin to the radical sites being out of plane of the phenylene rings, a twist between successive monomer units, and the difference between the p(z) orbital energy in carbon and silicon. The polyradical chains are electron insulators unlike substituted polysilene chains, though they are predicted to be good ferromagnets.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:30:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:30:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C, 119(7)3754-3761</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1932-7447</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp5112247</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17936</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
