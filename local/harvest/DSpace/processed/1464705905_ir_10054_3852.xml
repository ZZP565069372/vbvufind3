Feasibility of Reactive Distillation for Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2008, 48, 889-899; DOI 10.1021/ie071094p] as well as a detailed kinetics [Srinivas et al. Feasibility of Reactive Distillation for Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis. 2. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2009; DOI 10.1021/ie801887m]. In-built thermodynamic procedures of Aspen Plus, along with a detailed kinetic model that predicts product distribution, were used in performing the simulations. In this paper, we present detailed parametric studies like effect of reflux ratio, H(2)/CO feed ratio, number of nonreactive stages, etc. Conversion, yield, olefin-to-paraffin ratio and product distribution are the parameters used for comparison among the different cases studied. Within RD mode for FTS, some of the alternate column configurations like those with a side-heat removal and a side-draw, a hybrid column with reactive and nonreactive stages, are also explored and investigated.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-14T03:49:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-14T03:49:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDUSTRIAL &amp; ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH, 48(10), 4719-4730</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0888-5885</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie801888v</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/3852</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/3852</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
