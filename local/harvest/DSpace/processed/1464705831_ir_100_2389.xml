Acting as market signals of the transmission capability, ATC aids the independent system operator in ensuring that there is non-discriminatory access to the transmission services as sought by various market players, which information is pivotal for scheduling energy transactions. In this paper, however, based on the usage of ATC in the planning horizon, we propose the concept of adequacy resilience, which is an indicator of adaptability of power systems to ensure the required reliability levels. A detailed formulation of various adequacy resilience indices (ARIs) is presented, with the help of an illustrative example on the six-bus Roy Billinton Test System. ARIs can be potentially used as benchmarks for deciding upon the quantum of transmission system reinforcements to be deployed in transmission expansion planning studies. In the process, we also rely on the decision theory of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for engaging priority weightages where required.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-25T13:36:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-25T13:36:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>IEEE POWER AND ENERGY SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING 2010,-</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-1-4244-8357-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15735</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2389</dc:identifier><dc:source>PES General Meeting,Minneapolis, MN,JUL 25-29, 2010</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
