Bidentate ligand 2-NMe(2)CH(2)C(6)H(4)TeMe (4) was obtained from the reaction of 2-NMe(2)CH(2)C(6)H(4)TeLi (3) with MeI. The reaction, in addition to the expected telluride 4, afforded the novel 2-NMe(2)CH(2)C(6)H(4)TeI (5) and the tridentate ligand (2-NMe(2)CH(2)C(6)H(4))(2)Te (6) in poor yields. The compound is monomeric with weak intermolecular contacts between the Te and iodine atoms from adjacent molecules. Alternatively, ligand 6 has been obtained by the reaction of 2-NMe(2)CH(2)C(6)H(4)Li (2) and TeI2,, and its bonding capabilities have been evaluated. Ligand 6 displaces the THF ligand in Cr(CO)(5)THF to give the complex Cr(CO)(5)(2-NMe(2)CH(2)C(6)H(4))(2)Te (13) in which the ligand is bonded only through Te. Reaction of 6 with Cr(CH3CN)(3)(CO)(3) also gives the same complex 13. Structures of the free Ligand and its complex have been determined. Ligand 6 crystallizes in monoclinic space group P2(1)/n with a 10.2310(10) Angstrom, b = 5.6110(10) Angstrom, c = 32.010(3) Angstrom, beta 97.13 degrees(1), V = 1823.4(4) Angstrom(3), Z = 4, D-c = 1.443 mg/m(3) (Mo K alpha radiation at 293(2) K). The Te atom is pyramidal, and the Cr-Te distance of 2.6665 (9) Angstrom is the shortest known. The bidentate ligand 2-NMe(2)CH(2)C(6)H(4)TePh (7) has been similarly obtained from 2 by reaction with PhTeBr. Oxidative workup of 3 afforded the ditelluride (2-NMe(2)CH(2)C(6)H(4))(2)Te-2 (8). Reaction of 8 with diazomethane gave the telluroether ligand (2-NMe(2)CH(2)C(6)H(4)Te)(2)CH2 (9). Other multidentate ligands of the type (2-NMe(2)CH(2)C(6)H(4)Te)(2)E (10-12) (E = (CH2)(3), S, Se)were obtained by the reaction of Br(CH2)(3)Br, S, and Se with 3, respectively.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-14T22:59:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-14T22:59:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>1995</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ORGANOMETALLICS, 14(10), 4755-4763</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0276-7333</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/om00010a043</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4090</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4090</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
