L has been shown to act as selective ratiometric turn-on fluorescence sensor for Zn2+ up to a lowest concentration of 183 +/- 18 ppb (2.82 mu M) with a nine-fold enhancement by exhibiting blue-green emission. The coordination features of the species of recognition have been computationally evaluated by DFT methods and found to have distorted tetrahedral Zn2+ center in an N-4 core. The spherical nano-structural features observed for L in TEM are being transformed into the Koosh nano-flower like structure when complexed with Zn2+ and hence these two can be easily differentiated. Even the features observed in AFM can distinctly differentiate L from its Zn2+ complex.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T14:33:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T14:33:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>DALTON TRANSACTIONS, 41(6)1671-1674</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2dt11900e</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15112</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
