The unusual selenation reaction of aryllithium 13 has been studied by ES-MS spectrometry. The oxidative workup of in situ-generated lithium arylpolyselenolates (14-16) afforded a mixture of diorganopolyselenides (10, 11, 17, and 18), from which diorganotriselenide 11 was obtained as the major product, whereas lithium arylselenolate 22 gave only diselenide 6 on oxidation. Equimolar reactions of diorganotriselenide 11 with sulfuryl chloride and benzenethiol give the novel selenium halide [RSeSeCl (24)] and seleniumselenenyl sulfide (28), respectively. However, the reaction of triselenide 11 with an excess amount of halogenating reagents afforded selenenyl halides [RSeX; X = Cl (25), Br (26), 1 (27)]. The reaction of lithium arylpolyselenolates (14-16) with benzyl chloride gave a mixture of diselenide (10), unsymmetrical diselenide (31), benzyl selenide (32), and dibenzyl diselenide (33). The reaction of 14-16 with a.,W-dibromo-ortho-xylene gave the 10-membered diselenocine (34) and 26. GPx-like activities of diselenide 10 and triselenide 11 have been evaluated by using both benzenethiol and coupled reductase assay methods. Triselenide 11 shows much better GPx-like activity than diselenide 10. Crystal structures of organoselenium compounds (11, 25-27, 29, 32, and 34) were determined by single X-ray crystallography to study the ring size effect of the oxazine ring on Se...N intramolecular interactions.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-13T19:06:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-13T19:06:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ORGANOMETALLICS, 23(18), 4199-4208</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0276-7333</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/om049722f</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/3748</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/3748</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
