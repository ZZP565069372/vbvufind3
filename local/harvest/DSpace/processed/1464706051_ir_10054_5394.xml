Strong absorption peaks were observed at 1000 cm-1 due to the SiF(x) stretching mode. Small peaks were seen around 2300 and 640 cm-1 due to SiH stretching and wagging modes of absorption. The number of bonded hydrogen atoms in the film deposited at 0.05 M, 50 mA cm-2 was calculated to be 6.2579 x 10(21) and 1.2302 x 10(20) atm cm-3 using integrated absorption of the CH and SiH stretching modes, respectively. The absorption coefficient around the SiF(x) stretch region was found to vary from 1300-2500 cm-1 as the molarity of the electrolyte was increased. Binding energy shifts in X-ray photoelectron spectrum were used as a cross check to confirm the silicon bonding with carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and fluorine atoms. The absence of columnar growth in SEM photographs indicates no polysilane formation in the films.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CHAPMAN HALL LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-20T07:27:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-20T07:27:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>1992</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE, 27(17), 4762-4771</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-2461</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01166018</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5394</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5394</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
