The response is obtained by numerically solving the governing equations of motion. The effects of superstructure eccentricity ratio, uncoupled time period, and uncoupled torsional to lateral frequency ratio are investigated on peak responses of lateral, torsional, and edge displacements and accelerations, as well as damper forces. It is found that the semi-active dampers reduce the lateral-torsional deformations significantly and effects of torsional coupling on effectiveness of control system are more sensitive to variation of eccentricity and torsional to lateral frequency ratio.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T15:47:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T15:47:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING, 16(7)1043-1054</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13632469.2012.691339</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15191</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
