Ni and Ni/Pt electroplated layers are used as catalysts for the synthesis of the tubes. We observe that a very efficient filling of the tubes takes place with Ni. In some cases Ni/Pt filling is also observed inside the tubes. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies, coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray analyses of the tubes, indicate Ni nanorods with a highly symmetrical cylindrical structure. The diameter of the cylindrical nanorods is on the order of 40 nm, and their length is 660 nm. The nano area diffraction pattern of the nanorods reveals the cubic structure of nickel, and electron diffraction spots corresponding to (111), (200), (220) planes are evident. The lattice constant of Ni measured from the diffraction spots was found to be 0.347 +/- 0.0013 nm. This should be compared with 0.352 nm, the value of "a" in bulk Ni. The decrease in the lattice constant may be due to the strain experienced inside the tubes. Raman spectroscopy shows the typical signature of the tangential breathing mode present in the tubes at 1580 cm(-1) that shifts to a new position when the C-12 is replaced by C-13. The shift, however, is too small and is difficult to explain on the basis of mass difference. HRTEM experiments indicate the presence of Ni3C in the samples dominantly in the interfacial region.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-17T03:24:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-17T03:24:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY, 3(1-2), 165-170</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1533-4880</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2003.200</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4603</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4603</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
