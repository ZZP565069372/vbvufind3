While the maleimides can be obtained as the major products, in up to 90% yield, when the reaction is carried out in CO atmosphere, in absence of CO, the hydantoins are formed in up to 87% yield. Formation of maleimides has been shown to occur via the formation of a ferrole intermediate, whereas the hydantoins are proposed to form through successive insertion of isocyanate into the iron-acetylide bond. All compounds were characterized by spectroscopic methods and molecular structures of some compounds were established by single crystal X-ray diffraction method.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T15:56:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T15:56:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>DALTON TRANSACTIONS, 41(16)5045-5054</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2dt11942k</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15210</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
