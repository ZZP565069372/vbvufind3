For the purpose of comparison, circuits are also designed using PSO and Genetic Algorithm (GA). CMOS technologies from 0.35 mu m down to 0.13 mu m are used PVT (process, voltage, temperature) variations are considered during the design of circuits. We show that HPSO algorithm converges to a better solution, compared to PSO and GA. For CMOS Miller OTA, even performance of the circuit designed by HPSO algorithm is better than the performance of recently reported manually designed circuit. For the first time, design of this OTA, in 0.4 V supply voltage, is also presented. For this new design, HPSO algorithm has taken 23.5 minutes of CPU time on a Sun system with 1.2 GHz processor and 8 GB RAM</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE COMPUTER SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-25T04:38:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-25T04:38:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>22ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON VLSI DESIGN HELD JOINTLY WITH 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EMBEDDED SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS,427-432</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-0-7695-3506-7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1063-9667</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.14</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15604</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2072</dc:identifier><dc:source>22nd International Conference on VLSI Design held with 8th International Conference on Embedded Systems,New Delhi, INDIA,JAN 05-09, 2009</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
