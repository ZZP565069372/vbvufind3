Surface engineering involves the design of surface and substrate system to give a cost effective performance enhancement which the substrate is incapable to achieve. Various surface modification methods have been dealt with. Advanced methods of surface modification such as plasma spray methods, ion beams based techniques and laser surface modifications have been dealt in detail with the examples of achieving better corrosion, oxidation and wear properties of several iron base low alloy steels. Application to heat exchanger tubes in power plants and special austenitic alloys for aggressive environment has been discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T10:03:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T10:03:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>CORROSION AND ITS CONTROLS, VOLS I AND II,188-198</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-444-82916-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16260</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2741</dc:identifier><dc:source>International Conference on Corrosion (CORCON 97),MUMBAI, INDIA,DEC 03-06, 1997</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
