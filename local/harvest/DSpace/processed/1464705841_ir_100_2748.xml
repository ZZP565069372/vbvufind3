It was found that Zn added to Al-ln or AI-Sn acts synergistically with the activators to enhance the dissolution of Al. However, the synergism between Zn and In is stronger than that between Zn and Sn. Based on impedance and XPS results the existence of cations with valencies other than 3 (In+In2+ and Sn2+/Sn4+ ions) in the films have been suggested to be responsible for generation of point defects in the film, which in turn activate Al.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T10:34:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T10:34:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>CORROSION AND ITS CONTROLS, VOLS I AND II,1067-1073</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-444-82916-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16267</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2748</dc:identifier><dc:source>International Conference on Corrosion (CORCON 97),MUMBAI, INDIA,DEC 03-06, 1997</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
