The key enzyme, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid dioxygenase (1-HNDO, EC 1.13.11.38), was purified to homogeneity using a 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (3-H2NA)-affinity matrix. The enzyme was a homotetramer with a native molecular mass of 160 kDa and subunit molecular mass of similar to 39 kDa. It required Fe(II) as the cofactor and was specific for 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (1-H2NA), with K(m) 13.5 mu M and V(max) 114 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1). 1-HNDO failed to show activity with gentisic acid, salicylic acid and other hydroxynaphthoic acids tested. Interestingly, the enzyme showed substrate inhibition with a K(i) of 116 mu M. 1-HNDO was found to be competitively inhibited by 3-H2NA with a K(i) of 24 mu M. Based on the pH-dependent spectral changes, the enzyme reaction product was identified as 2-carboxybenzalpyruvic acid. Under anaerobic conditions, the enzyme failed to convert 1-H2NA to 2-carboxybenzalpyruvic acid. Stoichiometric studies showed the incorporation of 1 mol 02 into the substrate to yield 1 mol product. These results suggest that 1-HNDO from Pseudomonas sp. strain PPD is an extradiol-type ring-cleaving dioxygenase.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SOC GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T06:26:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T06:26:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MICROBIOLOGY-SGM, 155(), 3083-3091</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1350-0872</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.030460-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11995</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11995</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
