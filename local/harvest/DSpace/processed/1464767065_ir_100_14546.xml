Upon reduction of GO to form RGO C1s x-ray photoelectron spectra showed increase in graphitic carbon content, while ultraviolet photoelectron spectra showed increase in intensity corresponding to C2p-pi electrons (similar to 3.5 eV). X-ray excited Auger transitions C(KVV) and plasmon energy loss of C1s photoelectrons have been analyzed to elucidate the valence band structure. The effective number of (pi+sigma) electrons as obtained from energy loss spectra was found to increase by similar to 28% on reduction of GO. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.
