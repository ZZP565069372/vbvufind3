Powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis were used to characterize the as-prepared product, and the optical properties were studied by photoluminescence spectra. In addition, thermoluminescence and electron spin resonance studies have been carried out on SrS:Ce phosphor. The TL glow curve is broad and indicates two dominant peaks at 137 and 275 degrees C, with an additional peak, not clearly resolved, appearing as shoulder at similar to 362 degrees C. Two defect centers are observed at room temperature. One of them is characterized by an isotropic g-value of 2.0039 and is assigned to an F+ center. Step annealing measurements indicate a possible association between the F+ center and the 137 degrees C TL peak.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-31T06:15:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:51:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-31T06:15:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:51:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS, 160(7), 265-274</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1042-0150</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10420150500375534</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12611</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12611</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
