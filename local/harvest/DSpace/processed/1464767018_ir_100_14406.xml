Various parameters like topography, depth of soil, rainfall intensity, runoff, permeability of soil, and land use have been considered to identify the suitability of rainwater harvesting system for the campus. Runoff has been calculated using SCS-Curve Number technique. Suitable rain water harvesting structures such as surface water harvesting measures, soil conservation techniques, contour bunding and check dams have been identified and proposed to ensure effective and integrated rains water harvesting in the campus. The study reveals that water harvesting can also act as an effective flood mitigation measure for the study area apart from conservation of soil and water along with the enhancement of greenery.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Indian Association for Environmental Management</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-09-12T11:04:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-09-12T11:04:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Journal of Indian Association for Environmental Management, 35(3) 122-126</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0970-8480</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14406</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
