The comparison is done at two temperatures namely, 623 and 673K. The recovery, recrystallization and grain growth behaviour of this alloy is studied by electron backscatter diffraction and dislocation density estimation using X-ray line broadening analysis. It is found that recrystallization is slower in equibiaxial deformation condition compared to that in plane strain deformation condition during annealing. Significant recrystallization is observed after annealing for 60s at 673K and for 480s at 623K following plane strain deformation. Furthermore, significant recrystallization is associated with lower grain growth at 673K (approximate to 55m) as opposed to that at 623K (approximate to 75m). The results are explained on the basis of differences in both the strain paths.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T15:38:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T15:38:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE, 93(20)2613-2629</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786435.2013.781696</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15173</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
