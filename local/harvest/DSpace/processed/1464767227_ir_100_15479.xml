In this regard, alkyne and amine coordination pathways have been investigated for the hydroamination reaction between two representative substrates, namely, MeC CH and PhNH2, catalyzed by a gold(I) NHC based (NHC)AuCl-type pre-catalyst, namely, [1,3-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene]gold chloride. The amine coordination pathway displayed a lower activation barrier than the alkyne coordination pathway. The catalytic cycle is proposed to proceed via a crucial proton-transfer step occurring between the intermediates [(NHC)AuCH=CMeNH2Ph](+) (D) and [(NHC)Au(PhNHMeC=CH2)](+) (E), the activation barrier of which was found to be significantly reduced by a proton relay mechanism process assisted by the presence of any adventitious H2O molecule or even by any of the reacting PhNH2 substrates. The final hydroaminated enamine product, PhNHMeC=CH2, was further seen to be stabilized in its tautomeric imine form PhN=CMe2.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T06:51:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T06:51:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 51(10)5593-5604</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic2024605</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15479</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
