Their properties were evaluated as a function of volume of reinforcement in the composite and test conditions for understanding their behaviour in the elastic and plastic region. It was evident that the presence of reinforcement makes composites stronger in the elastic region and weaker in the plastic region.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MINERALS, METALS &amp; MATERIALS SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T14:17:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T14:17:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF COMPOSITES,41-45</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-87339-329-5</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16321</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2821</dc:identifier><dc:source>Symposium on Physical Properties of Composites at the 125th TMS Annual Meeting and Exhibition,ANAHEIM, CA,FEB 04-08, 1996</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
