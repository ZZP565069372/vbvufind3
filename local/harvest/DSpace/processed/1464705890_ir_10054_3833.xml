The effect of various parameters such as temperature, mole ratio, catalyst loading, and particle size was studied. Kinetic modeling was performed to obtain the parameters related to intrinsic kinetics. Pseudohomogeneous, Eley-Rideal, Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW), and modified LHHW models were developed. The kinetics for the side-reaction etherification was also investigated. The rate expressions would be useful in the simulation studies for reactive distillation. The experimental data generated for the reaction under total reflux were validated successfully using the developed rate equation and estimated values of kinetic parameters.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-14T02:21:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-14T02:21:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDUSTRIAL &amp; ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH, 42(10), 2146-2155</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0888-5885</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie0204989</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/3833</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/3833</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
