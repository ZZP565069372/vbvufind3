Based on 16SrDNA sequencing, the microorganism was identified as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The sequence of biodegradation of the three isomers when provided as a mixture (0.025%, w/v each) was elucidated. The dihydroxylated metabolites formed from the degradation of 2-HBA, 3-HBA and 4-HBA were identified as catechol, gentisate and protocatechuate, respectively, using the cell-free supernatant and cell-free crude extracts. Monooxygenases and dioxygenases that were induced in the cells of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in response to growth on mixture containing 2-HBA, 3-HBA and 4-HBA could be detected in cell-free extracts. These data revealed the pathways operating in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus for the sequential metabolism of monohydroxybenzoate isomers when presented as a mixture.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T10:12:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T10:12:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY &amp; BIOTECHNOLOGY, 24(6), 813-823</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0959-3993</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-007-9545-x</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12051</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12051</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
