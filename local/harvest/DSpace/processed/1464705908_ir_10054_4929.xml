A Heuristic Feeder Route Generation Algorithm was developed for generation of feeder routes. Optimal coordinated schedules for feeder buses were developed in coordination with the existing given schedules of suburban trains. Genetic algorithm, which is a robust optimization technique, is used for the optimizing coordinated schedules. Andheri and Vileparle suburban railway stations of Mumbai, India were selected as study areas. Feeder routes for public buses and coordinated schedules of public buses for the existing given schedules of suburban trains at the two suburban railway stations were successfully developed in this research.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-18T13:18:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-18T13:18:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE, 132(6), 518-522</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0733-947X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2006)132:6(518)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4929</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4929</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
