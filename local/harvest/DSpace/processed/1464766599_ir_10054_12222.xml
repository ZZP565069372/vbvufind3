A unique 12-node vector scheme has been proposed to represent machining feature families having variations in topology and geometry. The B-Rep CAD model in ACIS format is preprocessed to generate the feature representation vectors, which are then fed to the neural network for classification. The ANN-based feature-recognition (FR) system was trained with a large set of feature patterns and optimized for its performance. The system was able to efficiently recognize a wide range of complex machining features allowing variations in feature topology and geometry. The data of the recognized features was post-processed and linked to a feature-based CAPP system for CNC machining. The FR system provided seamless integration from CAD model to CNC programming.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER LONDON LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-30T06:41:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-30T06:41:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY, 41(9-10), 932-947</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0268-3768</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00170-008-1536-z</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12222</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12222</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
