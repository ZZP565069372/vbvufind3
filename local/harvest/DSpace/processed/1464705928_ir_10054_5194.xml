Mean (+/-SD) urinary iron excretion varied from 6.2+/-4.6 mg/d on 25 mg/kg/d of L1 to 42.3+/-37.1 mg/d on 100 mg/kg/d of L1. Mean (+/-SD) drop in S ferritin was 1465+/-990 mug/l after 5.0+/-0.8 months to 3641.2+/-2299.3 mug/l after 20.1+/-0.9 months of therapy. There was no evidence of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, ear or eye toxicity. L1-related arthralgia, which was reversible on dose reduction or stoppage, was seen in 20 patients (38.5%), while minor gastrointestinal (GI) tract symptoms occurred in seven (3.5%) cases. We conclude that although L1 is an effective iron chelator, further studies are required to understand the mechanism of L1 related arthralgia and also to find a safer but effective dose on which incidence of L1 related arthralgia is minimal.</dc:description><dc:publisher>BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-19T06:13:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-19T06:13:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>1992</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>BRITISH JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY, 82(2), 460-466</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0007-1048</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06445.x</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5194</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5194</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
