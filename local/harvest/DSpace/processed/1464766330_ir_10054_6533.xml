It is found that the resistivity behavior in these alloys is different in some aspects from those that contain Cr instead of Mn. In the Cr containing alloys a T2 term in the resistivity expression is found to be dominant at temperatures above T(min), while in Mn containing alloys the dominant term has an effective power of less than 1.5. It is conjectured that in Cr containing alloys it is the simultaneous presence of a negative T3/2 and a positive T2 term which leads to a second temperature minimum in resistivity at high temperature ( &gt; 100 K). In the Mn containing alloys, however, we do not find evidence for the presence of two such terms of opposite signs. It was also found that the presence of Ni increases the positive temperature coefficient of resistivity, but the increase was stronger in Mn containing alloys.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-24T20:42:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-24T20:42:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>1991</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS, 102(3), 297-304</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0304-8853</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-8853(91)90142-W</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/6533</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/6533</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
