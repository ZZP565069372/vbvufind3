In nature most crystalline solids exist in polycrystalline form. Simulating plastic flows in polycrystalline solids has wide ranging applications, from material processing to understanding intermittency of earthquake dynamics. Using phase field crystal (PFC) model we show that in sheared polycrystalline solids the atomic displacement field shows spatio-temporal heterogeneity spanning over several orders of length and time scales, similar to that in amorphous solids. The displacement field also exhibits localized quadrupolar patterns, characteristic of two dislocations of the opposite sign approaching each other. This is a signature of crystallinity at microscopic scale. Polycrystals being halfway between single crystals and amorphous solids, in terms of the degree of structural order, descriptions of solid mechanics at two widely different scales, namely continuum plastic flow and discrete dislocation dynamics turns out to be necessary here.</dc:description><dc:publisher>NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-17T04:30:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-17T04:30:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>SCIENTIFIC REPORTS, 3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep02728</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15953</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
