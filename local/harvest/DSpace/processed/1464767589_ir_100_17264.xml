The two glycosyl donors were prepared as thiophenyl (SPh) glycosides. Trichloroacetimidate (TCAl) coupling was employed for the first glycosylation step while thioglycoside activation was used for the second glycosylation to assemble the O-allyl trisaccharide. After removal of the anomeric allyl group, the trisaccharide was converted into a TCAl donor. Using cholesterol as an acceptor in combination with acetonitrile as a participating solvent to achieve beta-selectivity in glycosylation, a phyteumoside analog was obtained.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-29T06:04:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-29T06:04:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>RSC ADVANCES, 4(15)7611-7616</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>2046-2069</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra47523a</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17264</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
