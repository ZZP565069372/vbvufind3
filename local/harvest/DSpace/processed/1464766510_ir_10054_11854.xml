The reaction of copper hydroxide or copper acetate with phenyl phosphinic acid or diphenyl phosphinic acid in the presence of bdmpp-H produces the dinuclear complexes [Cu(bdmpp)(ppi)](2) (1) and [Cu(bdmpp)(dppi-H)](2)(dppi)(2) (2) (ppi-H = phenylphosphinic acid; dppi-H = diphenylphosphinic acid), respectively. The products have been characterized with the help of analytical, thermal, and spectroscopic (IR, UV-vis, and EPR) techniques. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of 1 and 2 reveal that the two bdmpp ligands hold together the dimeric copper unit in each complex through mu-O alkoxide and the pyrazolyl nitrogen ligating centers. Two phenyl phosphinate ligands additionally bridge the dicopper core in 1 to result in octahedral coordination geometry around each metal ion. The diphenyl phosphinic acid acts as a terminal ligand in 2, and thus completes a square pyramidal geometry around each copper ion. Both complexes show a very short Cu...Cu separation (3.001 and 3.065 angstrom for 1 and 2, respectively). The investigation of the magnetic properties reveals the efficiency of the double alkoxide bridge between the two paramagnetic copper ions to mediate strong antiferromagnetic interactions [J/k(B) = -620(5) K (-431(4) cm(-1)) and -685(5) K (-476(4) cm(-1)) for I and 2, respectively]. Compounds I and 2, along with a few other copper phosphate complexes, were tested as catalysts for the oxidative polymerization of 2,6-dimethylphenol; I and 2 were found to be efficient catalysts with an increased selectivity for the formation of the polyphenylene ether. However a related mononuclear octahedral copper complex [Cu(imz)(4)(dtbp)(2)] (dtbp-H = di-tert-butylphosphate) was found to be more efficient.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-28T21:49:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-28T21:49:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>DALTON TRANSACTIONS, (23), 2405-2410</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1477-9226</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b618559b</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11854</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11854</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
