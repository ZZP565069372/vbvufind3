TiO2 was allowed to form a complex, titanium catecholate precursor, in the presence of ammonium sulfate and concentrated sulfuric acid. The complex was filtered, washed with cold isopropyl alcohol and dried. Titanium hydride was prepared by heating the titanium catecholate precursor at 800 degreesC in a hydrogen atmosphere. The product was then dehydrogenated in 8 x 10(-6) torr vacuum to get nano size titanium powders. The powder characteristics have been studied by X-ray diffraction, ICP, laser particle size analysis, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The latter indicated that the powders were 21.6 nm in size and selected area diffraction showed the powders to be crystalline.</dc:description><dc:publisher>VSP BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-09-01T09:43:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-09-01T09:43:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ADVANCED POWDER TECHNOLOGY, 11(4), 415-422</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0921-8831</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156855200750172033</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12740</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12740</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
