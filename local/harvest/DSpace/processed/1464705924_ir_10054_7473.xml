Titration of these derivatives for their recognition towards M(2+) (where M = Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) were performed by following the fluorescence emission intensities in methanol solution. The picolyl derivative (L(4)) has been found to be well suited for Cu(2+) recognition (&lt;= 630 ppb) via the formation of 1: 1 complex that was further proven based on absorption as well as ESI MS studies. On the other hand. L(1) and L(2) were mainly insensitive towards M(2+), where as the carboxylic derivative (L(3)) shows fluorescence changes with almost all the metal ions and hence none of the L(1), L(2) and L(3) are suited for any M(2+) recognition. The studies clearly suggested that the chemical nature of the functional groups and the coordination preferences of the metal ion seem to play important role in the selective recognition of the metal ion.
