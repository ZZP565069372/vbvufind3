Therein we see a need to clearly understand the nature of technology development. After highlighting others' approaches towards this we go Into some detail about the role of IPR and look at the company, and macro level track record as also the industrial view. They lead to a case for customer orientation and to pointes for guiding policy. We refer to the limitations of the academic bureaucratic approach and urge the Developing countries (DCs) to Integrate their R&amp;D activity into their own economies. We conclude with the significant implications this holds for DC economies, practice and the teaching of engineering.</dc:description><dc:publisher>UICEE, FACULTY ENGINEERING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T11:08:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T11:08:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>GLOBAL CONGRESS ON ENGINEERING EDUCATION INCORPORATING: 5TH WORLD CONFERENCE ON ENGINEERING EDUCATION/4TH EAST-WEST CONGRESS ON ENGINEERING EDUCATION/1998 INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF ENGINEERING DEANS AND INDUSTRY LEADERS, CONGRESS PROCEEDINGS,460-463</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7326-1903-3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16277</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2756</dc:identifier><dc:source>Global Congress on Engineering Education,KRAKOW, POLAND,SEP 06-11, 1998</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
