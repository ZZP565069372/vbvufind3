The mixed-valent derivative bis[2-(phenylazo)phenyl-C, N']ditellurium dichloride (19), incorporating both a divalent and a tetravalent tellurium, was obtained serendipitously during the reduction of [2-(phenylazo)phenyl-C,N']tellurium(IV) trichloride (16) with hydrazine hydrate. Bis[2-(phenylazo)phenyl-C,N']telluride (10) has been synthesized by the ortho-lithiation route. Telluride 10, on treatment with SO(2)Cl(2) and Br(2), underwent oxidative addition to give the expected Te(IV) halogenated products bis[2-(phenylazo)phenyl-C,N']tellurium(IV) dichloride (13) and bis[2-(phenylazo)phenyl-C,N']tellurium(IV) dibromide (11), respectively. However, a similar reaction of 10 with 12 resulted in the formation of an unexpected telluronium cation, iodobis[2-(phenylazo)phenyl-C,N']telluronium triiodide (14), and [2-(phenylazo)phenyl-C,N']tellurenenyl(II) iodide (12). Alkaline hydrolysis of 16 under reflux conditions resulted in the formation of monomeric [2-(phenylazo)phenyl-C,N']tellurinic acid (20) and its sodium salt (21) as a cocrystal. Bis[[2-(phenylazo)phenyl-C,N']tellurium]-oxide (22) was obtained from the hydrolysis of [2-(phenylazo)phenyl-C,N']tellurium(II) chloride (17). The reaction of 13 with an alkaline solution resulted in the formation of the corresponding bis[2-(phenyl-azo)phenyl-C,N']tellurium(IV) oxide (23) and dichlorobis[2-(phenylazo)phenyl-C,N']tellurium(IV) oxide (24). The identity of all the derivatives was confirmed by multinuclear NMR ((1)H, (13)C, (125)Te) and FT-IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and ESI-MS. The structures for tellurium derivatives 6, 10-14, 17, 19, 20-23, and 23A were also confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Density functional theory (DFT) was utilized for optimizing the geometries of 11, 13, and 14 to examine the possibility of a four-membered intramolecular Te center dot center dot center dot N interaction.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-06-26T09:09:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-06-26T09:09:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ORGANOMETALLICS,30(3)534-546</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0276-7333</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/om1009022</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14264</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
