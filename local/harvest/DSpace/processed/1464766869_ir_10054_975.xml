sional elasticity problem.   The classical laminated plate theory is based on

the Kirchhoff hypothesis and ignores the effects of transverse shear deforma-

tion, normal stress, normal strain and nonlinear in-plane normal strain dis-

tribution through the plate thickness [ 1,2].  Two types of composite plates

are generally identified in practice: (i) 'fibre reinforced laminates' in

which layers of composite materials with high ratios of Young's-to-shear

modulii are bonded together and (2) 'sandwiches' in which layers of isotropic

materials with some layers having significantly lower elastic modulii than

others, are bonded together.   The effects of shear deformation are signific-

ant in these situations and thus the classical theory is inadequate.   Exact

elasticity solutions for flexure of some standard composite and sandwich

plate problems have been obtained by Pagano [ 3] and Pagano and Hatfield [4].

Whitney [5] and Mau [6] have presented first-order laminate theories in which

transverse shear strain is assumed constant through the thickness.   This re-

quired, however, use of a transverse shear correction factor which generally

varied with the lamination scheme.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-03-18T09:11:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T19:23:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-03-18T09:11:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T19:23:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>1987</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Mechanics Research Communications 14( 2), 107-113</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0093-6413</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0093-6413(87)90026-7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/975</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/975</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
