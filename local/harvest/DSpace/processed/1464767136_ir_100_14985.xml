It is proposed to react these alcohols in the mixture with acetic acid and separate the esters in pure form. Experiments are performed in a laboratory scale reactive distillation column, and a simulation model is validated. Different process alternatives exist, and we have compared them based on the total energy consumption as the criterion. The potentially cost-effective alternatives are identified. It is shown that reactive distillation, which is a proven intensification strategy for esterification of individual alcohols, can be a promising option for simultaneous esterification of mixture of alcohols, as well.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T13:18:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T13:18:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDUSTRIAL &amp; ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH, 52(47)16637-16647</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie401553z</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14985</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
