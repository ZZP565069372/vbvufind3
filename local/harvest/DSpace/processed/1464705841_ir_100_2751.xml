All the alloys showed a reduction in the oxidation rate in Ar/H-2/H2O. However, the alloys which incorporate considerable amount of Ti in the oxide showed very small difference in the oxidation rates. The alloy which incorporate significant amount of Ni in the oxide showed a marked reduction in the oxidation rate in Ar/H-2/H2O These anomalies are explained by assuming that the oxidation mechanism is changed from grain boundary diffusion to volume diffusion in Ar/H-2/H2O and therefore doping effect and proton incorporation controls the later part of oxidation. The insignificant reduction of oxidation rate of MA6000 in wet condition is explained as due to the resultant effect of donor and acceptor doping of Cr2O3 by Ti and Ni. The similar behavior of PM2000 is also due to doping effect of Al2O3 by Ti and Fe. The significant reduction in the oxidation rate of PM3030 in wet condition is due to acceptor doping of Cr2O3 by Ni.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T10:47:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T10:47:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>CORROSION AND ITS CONTROLS, VOLS I AND II,997-1003</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-444-82916-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16270</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2751</dc:identifier><dc:source>International Conference on Corrosion (CORCON 97),MUMBAI, INDIA,DEC 03-06, 1997</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
