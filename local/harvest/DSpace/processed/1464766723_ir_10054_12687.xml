The study is motivated by the findings of an earlier study conducted during 1987-90 for the graduates of the period 1975-90. It was found that women enrolment in the engineering courses was on the increase but the job market was not open for them. Enrolment rates have gone up significantly since then. The estimated range today is 25-30%. Data reveals that 31% of the women engineers are unemployed. The job and career opportunities for them continue to be limited Technical educational institutions are the main employment avenue with a noticeable increase in industrial employment. Unemployment is higher in the states and in the disciplines having higher enrolment. Getting the first job after graduation is the major hurdle in the career path of women engineers.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-09-01T06:18:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:51:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-09-01T06:18:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:51:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION, 19(4), 631-638</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0949-149X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12687</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12687</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
