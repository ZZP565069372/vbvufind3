Time signal analysis is done to distinguish various unsteady flow regimes and a flow regime map is proposed; demarcating steady, two types of periodic as well as quasi-periodic, and chaotic flow regimes. Temporal variation of flow structure and Nusselt number as well as friction factor are presented - in the various unsteady regimes - and discussed for a unified cause-and-effect study. Effect of different flow regimes on the thermal-hydraulic performance of wavy as compared to plane channel is presented. Effect of Prandtl numbers (0.01-100) is also studied.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T08:06:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T08:06:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>NUMERICAL HEAT TRANSFER PART A-APPLICATIONS, 68(6)638-662</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1040-7782</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1521-0634</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10407782.2014.994424</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/18123</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
