Estimation of outflow hydrographs from a channel reach is essential for the development of water-resources systems. A hydrologic-flow-routing technique for arid ephemeral channels is developed. The hydrologic-routing equations for the movement of flood waves are modified by the inclusion of a nonlinear volumetric transmission loss rate term, which is empirically estimated from the observed inflow-outflow data for a channel reach. The predicted outflow hydrographs match better with the observed than the outflow hydrographs generated through the lumped regression model for ephemeral channels. The hydrologic-flow-routing technique may also be used for ungaged channel reaches through parameterization.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-18T10:26:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-18T10:26:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>1995</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE, 121(6), 466-471</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0733-9429</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1995)121:6(466)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4879</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4879</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
