In this article, a new integrated approach is proposed that has the ability to reduce the response space dimensionality and also considers both location and dispersion effects in a correlated multiple response optimization problem. The proposed approach uses a principal component (PC)-based multivariate process capability index (MCpmk;PC) as an objective function for optimization. In addition, the nonlinear search algorithm can efficiently determine the best trade-off solution in the orthogonal PC space. Three different cases are selected to illustrate the effectiveness of the new proposed approach compared to a few selected existing approaches.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-17T04:53:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-17T04:53:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>QUALITY ENGINEERING, 25(3)266-281</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08982112.2013.765014</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15998</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
