The formulation includes the Sanders theory for doubly curved shells. Two of the HOSTS account for the effects of both transverse shear strains/stresses and the transverse normal strain/stress, while the third includes only the effects of transverse shear deformation. In these developments, a realistic parabolic distribution of transverse shear strains through the shell thickness is assumed. The equations of motion are obtained using Hamilton's principle. Solutions are obtained in closed-form using Navier's technique and by solving the eigenvalue equations. Numerical results are presented for the natural frequencies of laminated composite and sandwich shallow shells. The closed-form solutions presented herein for laminated composite plates and shells are compared with the available 3-D elasticity and analytical solutions and it is believed that the solutions for sandwich laminates using various higher-order displacement models will serve as the benchmark in future.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T01:54:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T01:54:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES &amp; MATERIALS, 8(2), 95-124</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1099-6362</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1099636206058779</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11913</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11913</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
