Rectification of energy transport in MMs in the presence of an appropriate external field is studied via symmetry breaking leading to directed energy transport or ratchet behaviour. Based on the earlier development of the K-G equation in a MM system with a split-ring resonator for antenna applications, a theoretical model for current density is worked out by symmetry analysis and its violation to characterize the ratchet effect. The time-averaged current shows interesting results against phase shift in the ac driver. These data are further related to various parameters, such as coupling and damping in the system. For MMs, this opens a new application for rectification using ratchets.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IOP PUBLISHING LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-17T04:31:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-17T04:31:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS, 46(20)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-3727</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1361-6463</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0022-3727/46/20/205102</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15955</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
