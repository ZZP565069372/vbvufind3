Energy integration of fired heaters with the background process helps in targeting fuel requirement and air preheat temperature prior to its detailed design. Existing integration procedures are applicable for processes with single fired heater only. However, in certain processes, multiple fired heaters are required to satisfy the total hot utility demand. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to target the number of fired heaters. Fuel requirement and air preheat temperature for every fired heater may have to be re-estimated to set achievable targets. With multiple fired heaters, duties of different fired heaters can be varied to simplify the design of the overall heat exchanger network.</dc:description><dc:publisher>NATL TECHNICAL UNIV ATHENS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T11:01:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T11:01:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>ECOS 2006: Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems, Vols 1-3,723-730</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-960-87584-2-1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15989</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2587</dc:identifier><dc:source>19th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems (ECOS 2006),Aghia Pelagia, GREECE,JUL 12-14, 2006</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
