The 710T specimens showed an increase in ductility and a marginal increase in strength with decreasing test temperature, whereas the 550T specimen exhibited an increased flow stress with very low ductility. The thermal component of flow stress (tau*), the activation volume (upsilon*) and activation energy (Delta H) were strongly affected by the microstructure. A decrease in tau* observed in the 710T specimens, compared with that of pure iron, at temperatures below 200 K can be attributed to solid solution softening by the dissolved nitrogen atoms. Further, the variations in upsilon* and Delta H with stress and temperature supports the importance of the Peierls mechanism for plastic deformation, and the movement of dislocations by double kink formation was found to be strongly affected by free nitrogen atoms.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CARL HANSER VERLAG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-19T12:42:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-19T12:42:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ZEITSCHRIFT FUR METALLKUNDE, 89(9), 629-634</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0044-3093</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5303</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5303</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
