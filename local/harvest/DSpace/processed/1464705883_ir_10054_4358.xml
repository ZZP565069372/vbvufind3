The energies and widths from third order decoupling for shape resonances are close to those obtained using second order self-energy approximants. The energy and width calculated using the third order decoupling for Auger resonances provide better agreement with experimental results, with the much more economic quasi-particle third order decoupling being just as effective. The differences between FDAs from different decouplings are analyzed to elicit the role of correlation and relaxation: in the formation and decay of shape and Auger resonances.
