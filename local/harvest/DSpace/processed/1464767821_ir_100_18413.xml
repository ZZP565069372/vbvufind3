I find substantial level of gender based within-household inequality in immunization status (with large inter-country variations) in the countries studied. Further, I estimate household fixed-effects models for immunization status and find significant difference between the immunization status of male and female children (with female children at a disadvantaged position) in India and Nepal.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ECONOMICS BULLETIN</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T11:01:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T11:01:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ECONOMICS BULLETIN, 35(2)911-923</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1545-2921</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/18413</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
