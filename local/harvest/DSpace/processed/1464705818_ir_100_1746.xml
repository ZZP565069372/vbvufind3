Its TSL glow curve shows a major peak around 360degreesC with minor peaks around 110degreesC and 230degreesC. The optimum concentrations of the dopants are found to be 200 ppm each. Its gamma sensitivity is 1.2 times as compared to CaSO4:Dy (0.1 mol%). The Optimum Pre-irradiation annealing treatment is found to be 650degreesC, 15 min. Its PL emission shows a band at 370 nm with excitation band at 250 nm. Dose to TSL response shows that its response is linear up to the gamma dose of 100 Gy for irradiations carried out at RT. An irradiated sample shows a distinct new ESR signal, which is tentatively assigned to an electron/hole localised on one of the oxygen(s) of the phosphate group. Step annealing experiments show decay of the defect centre around 340degreesC. This correlates well with the TSL peak around 360degreesC.</dc:description><dc:publisher>NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY PUBL</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-22T13:24:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-22T13:24:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Article; Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY,100,251-253</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0144-8420</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/14906</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/1746</dc:identifier><dc:source>13th International Conference on Solid State Dosimetry,ATHENS, GREECE,JUL 09-13, 2001</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
