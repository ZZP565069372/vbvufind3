In this displacement based theory, constitutive relations between shear-stresses and shear-strains are satisfied in both the layers, and, therefore, shear correction factor is not required. In-plane displacement is such that the resultant of normal stress acting over the cross section is zero. Compatibility at the layer interface in respect of in-plane displacement is also satisfied. Present theory contains even less number of unknown variables than those of the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT). In the present formulation, effects of rotary inertia and other inertias are also included. The efficacy of the present theory is demonstrated through the illustrative example.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T01:37:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T01:37:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF REINFORCED PLASTICS AND COMPOSITES, 21(16), 1477-1492</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0731-6844</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0731684402021016472</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11907</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11907</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
