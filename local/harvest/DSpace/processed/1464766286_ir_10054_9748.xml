The observations show interesting uncorrelated brightness temperature variations at the two wavelengths. The observed low brightness temperatures indicate that the emission is mainly originating from the chromosphere - corona transition region. A transition region model with constant pressure and power-law temperature variation as a function of height has been assumed to analyse the data. The uncorrelated variation of the observed brightness temperature at the two wavelengths suggest different dominant emission mechanisms (bremsstahlung at 2cm and gyro-resonance at 6 cm) operative at the two wavelengths. It is shown that an independent variation of a few percent in the magnetic field (900 +/-45 G) and a factor of two variation in the density (2 to 4 x 10(10) cm-3) over a time scale of few hours is required to explain the uncorrelated brightness temperature variations at the two wavelengths.</dc:description><dc:publisher>KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-17T04:41:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:44:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-17T04:41:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:44:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>1990</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IAU SYMPOSIA, (142), 489-493</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0074-1809</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9748</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9748</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
