The inlet average concentration of both the reactants over a period is assumed to be constant. Significant improvement in the yield of product is obtained by increasing the feed concentration of both the reactants in the first fraction of a period. The effect of adsorption capacity of the catalyst, reaction rate constants, and inlet feed mean concentration of the reactants are evaluated. The deactivation of active sites, due to product inhibition, introduces resonance in the yield versus cycle split. The yield of product shows a minimum with respect to cycle split for the type of forcing where one of the reactant concentrations increases and the second reactant concentration decreases in the first fraction of a period.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CANADIAN SOC CHEMICAL ENGINEERING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-19T12:03:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-19T12:03:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>1990</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, 68(6), 968-973</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0008-4034</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5292</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5292</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
