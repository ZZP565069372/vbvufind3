The new cluster 3 was formed in good yield when a benzene solution of 6 was refluxed with sulfur powder. Similarly, 2 was obtained when a benzene solution of 6 was refluxed with tellurium powder. A new cluster with three different chalcogen ligands, Cp(2)Mo(2)Fe(2)SSeTe(CO)(6) (8), was obtained when a benzene solution of 6 was refluxed in the presence of selenium powder. Structures of 1-4, 6, and 8 were established by crystallographic methods. The structures of 1-3 and 8 consist of Mo2Fe2 butterfly cores with a mu(4)-Te atom and two mu(3)-chalcogen atoms (1, Te and Te; 2, S and Te; 3, S and S; 8, S and Se) capping the two Mo2Fe faces. Each Mo atom has a Cp ligand, and each Fe atom has three terminally bonded carbonyl groups. The structure of 4 conists of a Mo2FeTe tetrahedron with each Mo possessing a Cp ligand and two terminally bonded carbonyl groups and the Fe atom having three terminal carbonyl groups attached to it. The structure of 6 consists of a Mo2Fe2 tetrahedron. One Mo2Fe face is capped by a mu(3)-S ligand and the other by a mu(3)-Te atom. The Fe-Fe bond is bridged by a carbonyl group; there are two terminally bonded carbonyl groups attached to each Fe atom. A semitriply bridging earbonyl group is attached to one Mo atom. The other Mo atom has one terminal carbonyl group. Each Mo atom has one Cp ligand attached to it.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-14T12:19:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-14T12:19:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:48:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ORGANOMETALLICS, 15(7), 1898-1904</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0276-7333</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/om950876s</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/3950</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/3950</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
