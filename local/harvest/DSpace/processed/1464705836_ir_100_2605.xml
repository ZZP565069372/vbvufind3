A special device for inducing non-uniform settlements during centrifuge test has been custom designed, developed and calibrated. Centrifuge tests were performed in a 4.5 m radius large beam centrifuge facility available at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. The study is focused in understanding the deformation behaviour of moist compacted soil liners with and without randomly reinforced fibers. Three centrifuge model tests were performed on a compacted soil liner with and without fibers. The influence of the randomly reinforced fibers on the integrity of compacted soils liners at the onset of non-uniform settlements has been demonstrated through centrifuge modeling technique adequately.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MILLPRESS SCIENCE PUBLISHERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T12:27:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T12:27:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>Geosynthetics, Vols 1-4,1671-1674</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>90-5966-044-7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16007</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2605</dc:identifier><dc:source>8th International Conference on Geosynthetics (8ICG),Yokohama, JAPAN,SEP 18-22, 2006</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
