The problem, in a natural way, reduces to the MRA of the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We then show that for processes synthesized from Gaussian white process by fractional integration of order alpha greater than or equal to 1, this definition is applicable. The MRA results in an orthogonal expansion of these processes. The region of interest is the positive real line. Using this representation then a decomposition of a wider class of Gaussian processes is given. This representation is multiscale in two ways : firstly, the Gaussian process is split into various component processes characterized by the smoothness of their sample paths and secondly, each of these component processes has a MRA as defined in this paper.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T22:29:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T22:29:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1998 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1-6,2393-2396</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-4428-6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1520-6149</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16435</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2922</dc:identifier><dc:source>IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP 98),SEATTLE, WA,MAY 12-15, 1998</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
