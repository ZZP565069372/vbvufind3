Here we explore the Java cryptographic classes which make It possible to generate keys and both, create and verify digests and signatures. In addition, shared key and public key encryption are supported, This enables one to implement pure-Java solutions for payment protocols such as SET[1] (Secure Electronic Transaction), Millicent([2]), e-checks([3]) and NetBill([4]). Alternatively, E-commerce Implementations based on SSL (Secure Socket Layer) are facilitated by the SSL API's. We present snippets of code for tasks such as key generation, digest/signature creation and encryption, Since these tasks are also the building blocks for a secure E-commerce payment system, we also include performance numbers that could help Implementors project the load on potential bottlenecks such as payment gateways.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INST ELECTRONICS TELECOMMUNICATION ENGINEERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-03T06:21:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-03T06:21:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW, 17(4), 215-220</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0255-9609</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8923</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8923</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
