This physical process creates the initial acceleration in shock-wave based micro-fluidic devices, which have promising medical and drug/DNA delivery applications. The velocities of the water interfaces were measured through real-time high-temporal/spatial resolution visualizations. Based on modified Tait equation-of-state and the concept of Reimann-invariants, an analytical expression was deduced to calculate the particle velocity behind the unloading wave. The experiments and analyses confirm that the mass motion behind the shock-wave accelerates to very high velocities, a requirement for effective momentum delivery in micro-jet devices.
