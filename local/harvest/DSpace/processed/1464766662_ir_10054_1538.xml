has been underway for close to a decade now. So
far, this research has focused mainly o11 identifying
the appropriate choice, with respect to meeting the
real-time goals, for the various database system policies
such as priority assignment, transaction concurrency
control, memory management, etc. (see [16] for
a recent survey). However, the design and evaluation
of concurrency control algorithms for indexes,
which are an integral part of database systems, has
received virtually no attention in the real-time environment.
In our view, this lacuna is rather surprising
since it appears reasonable to expect that indexes
would be one of tbe primary mechanisms by which a
well-designed RTDBS would try to meet transaction
timing constraints. In this situation, using an "offthe-
shelf" index concurrency control algorithm that
has not been specifically designed for the real-time
environment may lead to many transactions missing
their deadlines.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ACM</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-06-20T06:10:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T15:01:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:04:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:50:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-20T06:10:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T15:01:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:04:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:50:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ACM SIGMOD Record 25(1), 13-17</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0163-5808</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/381854.381870</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1538</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1538</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
