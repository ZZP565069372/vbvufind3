The interaction between the oscillators is governed by their spatial movement. The coupling is unidirectional and is of the intermediate kind, with the spatial vision of each oscillator deciding the number of oscillators to which it is coupled. We also analyze how the extent of synchronization, characterized by the order parameter, depends upon the system parameters, such as spatial vision, spatial motion, and strength of the coupling. The model systems employed here are the Van der Pol oscillator and the Brusselator. Furthermore, for the same spatial configuration, both linear and nonlinear coupling schemes are studied and their results compared.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER PHYSICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T12:39:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T12:39:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>PHYSICAL REVIEW E, 86(5)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.86.056213</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15569</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
