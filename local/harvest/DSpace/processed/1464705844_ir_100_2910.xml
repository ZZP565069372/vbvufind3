The problem is tackled by making a smart, adaptive and self-controlling structure that requires robust controller. The newly invented Second Order Sliding Mode Controller (SSMC) not only retains the robustness properties of the classical Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) but also eliminates the drawback of the SMC that is high frequency chattering due to high frequency switching. The high frequency switching can excite the unmodelled dynamics and makes the system unstable. The work presented in this paper is the second order sliding mode controller design for active vibration control of the smart structure. The controller is designed for SISO plant and also for MIMO plant. The main objective of the active vibration controller is to reduce vibration of the system using system response. The efficacy of the controller is checked at various positions of the sensor/actuator on the structure and the conclusion is drawn.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T21:10:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T21:10:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>2005 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL APPLICATIONS (CCA), VOLS 1AND 2,1691-1696</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-9353-8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1085-1992</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16417</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2910</dc:identifier><dc:source>IEEE International Conference on Control Applications,Toronto, CANADA,AUG 28-31, 2005</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
