In this paper, we introduce the notion of soft word sense disambiguation which states that given a word, the sense disambiguation system should not commit to a particular sense, but rather, to a set of senses which are not necessarily orthogonal or mutually exclusive. The senses of a word are expressed by its WordNet synsets, arranged according to their relevance. The relevance of these senses are probabilistically determined through a Bayesian Belief Network. The main contribution of the work is a completely probabilistic framework for word-sense disambiguation with a semi-supervised learning technique utilising WordNet. WordNet can be customized to a domain using corpora from that domain. This idea applied to question answering has been evaluated on TREC data and the results are promising.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MASARYKOVA UNIV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-18T14:49:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-18T14:49:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>GWC 2004: SECOND INTERNATIONAL WORDNET CONFERENCE, PROCEEDINGS, (), 291-298</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10052</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10052</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
