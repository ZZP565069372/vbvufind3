The starting point of analysis is the inability of the 1-D codes to account for natural convection in the heater. Present 1-D models are unable to account for axial diffusion in the fluid caused by natural convection. Start-up from rest and many other characteristics cannot be simulated using classical 1-D models because of the inherent tendency of the predicted dynamics to be attracted by zero flow condition. The paper presents an elegant approach for taking into account both natural and forced convection. The enhancement of fluid motion and thermal mixing by natural convection is an important consideration in the design of nuclear reactors. Hence, the model developed is of direct relevance to nuclear reactor thermal hydraulics. The model developed for natural convection has been validated against the CFD simulations. The model developed has been incorporated in a classical 1-D model developed by the authors previously. The application of model to a rectangular single-phase natural circulation loop show that the model can predict the loop behavior from start-up with fidelity. The model reproduces most of the characteristics like unidirectional oscillation, bidirectional oscillations and chaotic switching reasonably well. Finally, model has been used to investigate the phenomenon of hysteresis observed in experimental loop. The paper also brings out the role of constitutive laws for wall friction in predicting the loop dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
