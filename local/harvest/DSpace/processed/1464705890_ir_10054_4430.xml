One of such systems is LuBa2Cu3O7-delta a systematic investigation of structural (in)stability of its superconducting phase is presented here. Our analysis suggests that the system suffers from internal strain due to lower ionic radius of LU(3+); however, the structure can be stabilized only as oriented films on [100] LaAlO3, [100] SrTiO3, and [100] MgO, with excellent superconducting properties (J(c) approximate to 5.0x10(6) A cm(-2) at 77 K). We have also investigated similar compounds having their stability close to their crystallographic limit. The important feature of these metastable phases is that they grow only as oriented films. Free energy of epitaxial growth of strained films are investigated and a simple growth model is proposed based on our observation. Importance of this growth model in explaining the superconductor-normal-metal-superconductor type of junctions, observed in high-T-c superconductors is highlighted.
