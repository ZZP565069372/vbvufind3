The changes observed in the OH and carbonyl stretching frequency region of the blend compositions studied are discussed in terms of hydrogen bonding interaction between the OH groups of epoxy resin and carbonyl groups of PVPr and PMMA. Qualitative as well as quantitative data have been obtained about these interactions and are compared. The FTi.r. results indicate a high degree of mixing at the molecular level for both blend systems at all compositions studied. It is observed that in the PVPr/epoxy blend system the strength of the hydrogen bonding interaction between the OH groups of epoxy and C=O groups of PVPr is much stronger than the interaction between the self-associated OH groups in pure epoxy resin. A more uniform hydrogen bonding between the OH groups of epoxy and C=O groups of PMMA was observed and is also discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ELSEVIER SCI LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-22T07:51:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-22T07:51:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:52:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>1992</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>POLYMER, 33(17), 3593-3597</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0032-3861</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0032-3861(92)90641-9</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/6157</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/6157</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
