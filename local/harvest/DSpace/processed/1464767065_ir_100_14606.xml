The Ba- doped compositions of GdAlO3 were prepared through citrate gel process. Analysis of the phases was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The morphology of the calcined powders was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The electrical conductivity of Gd1-xBaxAlO3-delta (x = 0-0.04) was measured using ac impedance spectroscopy as a function of temperature ranging from 300 to 1000 degrees C under air. The solid solubility of barium in GdAlO3 was found to be less than 4 mol%. The undissolved barium precipitated in the form of BaAl2O4 phase. The barium doped GdAlO3 powders obtained after calcination at 1000 degrees C was found to be porous agglomerate composed of nanocrystalline grains. The total electrical conductivity of Ba-doped GdAlO3 increased with increasing amounts of barium up to 2 mol% doping. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
