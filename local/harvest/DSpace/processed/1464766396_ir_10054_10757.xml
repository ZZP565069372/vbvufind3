Both films were subjected to N2+ ion bombardment at a dose of 5 x 10(16) ions cm-2, at an accelerated voltage of 150 kV. Both the films were studied by means of Auger depth profiling. XPS and SEM observations were also taken when both gold and copper were consistently seen. It is observed that the interface is less disturbed when implantation is from the gold side. Secondly, copper forms metastable bonds with nitrogen whereas nitrogen remains only as an interstitial in the gold matrix. It is observed that nitrogen bubbles are formed when the bombardment is from the copper side. This has been explained on the basis of radiation induced segregation of nitrogen at the grain boundaries, surfaces and interfaces.</dc:description><dc:publisher>PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-24T04:27:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:56:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-24T04:27:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:56:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>1991</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>VACUUM, 42(8-9), 543-546</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0042-207X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0042-207X(91)90934-B</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10757</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10757</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
