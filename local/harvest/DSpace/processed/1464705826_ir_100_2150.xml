The composite specimen were prepared by driving a small diameter PVC casing into the sample and then backfilling the cavity with sand column after removing the casing. The results seem to suggest that the smear zone does not have any significant effect on the shear strength of the composite specimen if sufficient time is allowed for excess pore pressures to dissipate during consolidation. Difference in the measured strength of specimens prepared with and without smear was also small when the specimens with smear were not permitted to completely consolidate prior to undrained shear.</dc:description><dc:publisher>RES PUBL SERV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-25T06:42:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-25T06:42:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>GROUND IMPROVEMENT TECHNOLOGIES AND CASE HISTORIES,509-514</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-981-08-3124-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.3850/GI070</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15634</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2150</dc:identifier><dc:source>1st International Symposium on Ground Inprovement Technologies and Case Histories,Singapore, SINGAPORE,DEC 09-12, 2009</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
