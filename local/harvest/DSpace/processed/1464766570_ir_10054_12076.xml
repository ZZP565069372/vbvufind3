Corrosion performance of the nano-composite coatings were evaluated by applying these nanocomposites on mild steel substrate and exposing them to salt spray, humidity, and accelerated weathering. Mechanical properties were studied by subjecting the coating to scratch and abrasion test. The results showed that, with an increase in the concentration of nano-Al(2)O(3) there was an improvement in the corrosion resistance, UV resistance, and mechanical properties of the coatings indicating the positive effect of addition of nano-Al(2)O(3) particles in the coatings. Further, the transparency of the coating was not altered, maintaining the optical clarity of the coating.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T12:01:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T12:01:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF COATINGS TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH, 6(3), 353-368</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1547-0091</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11998-008-9127-3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12076</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12076</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
