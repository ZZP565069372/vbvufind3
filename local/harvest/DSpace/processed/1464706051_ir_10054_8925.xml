Fault tree technique had been widely employed in the reliability analysis of safety systems as a part of Level 1 Probabilistic Safety Assessment conducted for Nuclear Power Plants. This study presents the use of petrinets in failure analysis. It Is demonstrated that petrinets are more efficient than fault tree. Another arena, where petrinets were successfully employed, is in the evaluation of redundant systems where time is also one of the parameters. Analyses are presented with the help of appropriate case studies.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INST ELECTRONICS TELECOMMUNICATION ENGINEERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-03T06:27:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-03T06:27:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW, 18(1), 61-64</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0255-9609</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8925</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8925</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
