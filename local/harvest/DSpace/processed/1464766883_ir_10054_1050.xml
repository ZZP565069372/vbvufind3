Currently the designers obtain these values with the help of graphical procedures and empirical equations. An alternative to this in the form of a neural network is presented in this paper. The networks were trained by combining the existing deterministic relations with a random component. The trained network was validated with the help of fresh laboratory observations. The validation results confirmed usefulness of the neural network approach for this application. The predicted breaking height and water depth were more accurate than those obtained traditionally through empirical schemes. Introduction of a random component in network training was found to yield better forecasts in some validation cases.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-03-23T05:11:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T20:01:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-03-23T05:11:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T20:01:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Ocean Engineering 30(9), 1163-1178</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0029-8018</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0029-8018(02)00086-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1050</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1050</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
