The advent of high temperature superconductors (HTSC) in 1986 focused attention onto identifying and classifying other possible phases of vortex matter in all classes of superconductors by a variety of techniques. We have collated evidences in support of a proposal to construct a generic phase diagram for weakly pinned superconducting systems, based on their responses to ac and de magnetic fields. The phase diagram comprises quasi-glassy phases, like, the Bragg glass, a vortex glass and a reentrant glass in addition to the (completely) amorphous phases of pinned and unpinned variety. The characteristic metastability and thermomagnetic history dependent features recognized amongst various glassy vortex phases suggest close connections between vortex matter and other disordered condensed matter systems, like, spin glasses, super cooled liquids/ structural glasses, etc. A novel quenched random disorder driven fracturing transition stands out amongst other noteworthy facets of weakly vortex pinned vortex matter.</dc:description><dc:publisher>PHYSICAL SOCIETY JAPAN</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-27T04:50:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:57:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-27T04:50:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:57:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN, 69(), 262-275</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0031-9015</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11543</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11543</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
