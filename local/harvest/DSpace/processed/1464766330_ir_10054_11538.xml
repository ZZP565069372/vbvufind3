The HA formation was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. HA prepared by this unconventional route was subjected to biocompatibility assay by a cell-culture method using the hybridoma cell line AE9D6 in both conventional Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM) and simulated body fluid (SBF), both supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. HA synthesised through this unconventional method showed the presence of tricalcium phosphate which can be reduced only after heat treatment at 1150 degrees C. The HA conformed to the X-ray data index file for hydroxyapatite. Biocompatibility assays showed reproducible growth and secretion patterns of cells both in DMEM as well as in SBF, thereby indicating the effectiveness of this method for the production of biocompatible HA.</dc:description><dc:publisher>PETER PEREGRINUS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-27T04:16:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:57:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:44:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-27T04:16:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:57:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:44:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MEDICAL &amp; BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING &amp; COMPUTING, 36(5), 654-658</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0140-0118</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02524439</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11538</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11538</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
