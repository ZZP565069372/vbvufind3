The strengths of the halo-acids and hence the electronegativities of the halogens played an important role in governing the reaction processes which controlled the growth kinetics of the films. F doping affected the growth rate of a firn the least, whereas Cf and Br doping reduced the growth rate to an increasing extent. The structural properties were less affected by doping. The films were polycrystalline and remained highly textured along the [200] direction irrespective of the dopant as well as of the doping level. The grain size remained essentially the same regardless of the dopant.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IOP PUBLISHING LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-04T01:32:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-04T01:32:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS, 29(12), 2988-2991</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-3727</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0022-3727/29/12/008</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9202</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9202</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
