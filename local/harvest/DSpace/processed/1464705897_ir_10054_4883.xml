All the significant effects of tower-water interaction and tower-foundation-soil interaction are included in the analysis. The hydrodynamic effects of outside and inside water are approximately by added mass functions, which can be determined to a useful degree of accuracy without requiring regorous three-dimensional analysis of the two fluid domains. The simplified response spectrum analysis (SRSA) procedure utilizes convenient methods for computing: (1) The first two natural frequencies and modes of vibration of the tower; and (2) the modifications to the vibration period and the damping ratio of the fundamental vibration mode due to tower-foundation-soil interaction. The procedure is demonstrated to be accurate enough for preliminary design and safety evaluation of towers.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-18T10:39:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-18T10:39:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>1991</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING-ASCE, 117(3), 767-788</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0733-9445</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1991)117:3(767)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4883</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4883</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
