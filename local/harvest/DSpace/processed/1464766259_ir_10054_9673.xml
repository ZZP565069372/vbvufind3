The system is subjected to lateral excitation that is modelled as a broad-band stationary random process. MTMDs with uniformly distributed frequencies are considered for this purpose and they are arranged in a row covering the width of the system. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the effectiveness of MTMDs on reducing the response of torsionally coupled system. The parameters include the eccentricity of the main system, its uncoupled. torsional to lateral frequency ratio and the damping of MTMDs. It is shown that the effectiveness of MTMDs in controlling the lateral response of the torsionally coupled system decreases with the increase in the degree of asymmetry. Further, the effectiveness of MTMDs, designed for an asymmetric system by ignoring the effect of the torsional coupling, is overestimated.</dc:description><dc:publisher>JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-17T00:05:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-17T00:05:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING &amp; STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS, 26(3), 307-317</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0098-8847</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1096-9845(199703)26:3&lt;307::AID-EQE639&gt;3.0.CO;2-8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9673</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9673</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
