Study of such processes is an active area of research in physical chemistry. The effect is most interesting when the molecules that participate in PET are charged. In the present article, the modulation of PET has been studied for two anionic fluorophores: Lucifer Yellow CH and chlorin p(6) with Methylviologen dication. PET, manifested in the quenching of fluorescence of the fluorophores, has been modulated by incorporating the molecules in organized assemblies like micelles, reverse micelles and supramolecular hosts. The dynamics of the process has been monitored in the femtosecond to nanosecond timescale. The modulation of the electron transfer has been found to be occurring mainly due to the disruption of contact ion pairs formed between the fluorophores and the quencher. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
