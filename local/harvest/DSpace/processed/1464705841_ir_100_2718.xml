In recent years, desiccant cooling systems (DCS) have received considerable attention due to their inherent ability to use low-grade thermal energy and reduce the latent cooling load significantly. DCS have the ability to provide efficient humidity and temperature control while reducing the electrical energy requirement as compared to a conventional vapour compression system (VCS). This paper presents the potential of a hybrid cooling system (HCS) along with simulation results indicating the advantages of this system as compared to VCS. Calcium chloride solution is used as liquid desiccant (LD) in the system as it costs less and is non toxic. Simulation results, for a location in Mumbai, are reported. The cooling effect and COP of the HCS increases by 60% and 45% respectively when one ton compressor was used in a HCS instead of VCS.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SCIENCE PRESS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T21:45:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T21:45:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SORPTION HEAT PUMP CONFERENCE,414-418</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1-880132-06-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16138</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2718</dc:identifier><dc:source>International Sorption Heat Pump Conference (ISHPC 2002),SHANGHAI, PEOPLES R CHINA,SEP 24-27, 2002</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
