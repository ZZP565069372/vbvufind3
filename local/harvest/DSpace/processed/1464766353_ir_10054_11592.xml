The analysis extends earlier work [1] in which the tangential velocity at the surface of the porous material was neglected. The problem is solved analytically together with associated boundary conditions. It is found that there exists a strong interaction between roughness and slip effects. A comparison with the case of an infinitely long journal bearing [2] shows that there are significant qualitative and quantitative differences in load capacity and coefficient of friction. However, the slip-induced variations in friction force are similar to those for an infinitely long journal bearing.</dc:description><dc:publisher>PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING PUBLISHING LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-27T07:54:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:57:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-27T07:54:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:57:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:45:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART J-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING TRIBOLOGY, 217(J1), 59-70</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1350-6501</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1243/135065003321164802</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11592</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11592</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
