Bi-metallic tube is one such multi-material component with different materials on internal and outer surfaces. This paper briefs about fabrication of a bi-metallic tubular structure with an indigenously developed 3.5 kW CO(2) laser integrated with a beam delivery system, a 5-axis CNC work station along with a powder feeding sub-system. The bi-metallic tube was fabricated with cobalt based alloy Stellite 21 on inner diameter and type 316L stainless steel on the outer diameter. Besides, a stainless steel tube with an internal step of Stellite 21 was also fabricated. As-fabricated bi-metallic structure was structurally sound and carried desired transition in chemical composition and hardness across its wall thickness.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER INDIA</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-30T06:08:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-30T06:08:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>TRANSACTIONS OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF METALS, 62(2), 169-174</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0019-493X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12215</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12215</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
