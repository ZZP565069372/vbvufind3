To surmount this problem, a new RP process that makes use of adaptive slicing with first order approximation of the edges is proposed. In manufacturing, one uses a fast roughing process followed by one or more finishing processes that are slow but accurate. The methodology adopted in the proposed RP process also uses this concept of two-level processing, viz., near-net building of the layer and net-shaping it by high-speed machining. This new methodology, which is at conceptual stage, would result in faster prototypes with better accuracy.
