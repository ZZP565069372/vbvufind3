The metric parameters suggest a neutral pi acceptor bridge containing coupled s-trans configurated alpha-diimines, which are coordinated by two ruthenium(II) centers. DFT calculations confirm the experimental structure and oxidation state assignment of the rac form; both diastereoisomers are present in solution according to H-1 NMR spectroscopy. A very intense long-wavelength MLCT absorption at 630 nm (epsilon = 66 800 M-1 cm(-1)) and a weaker near-IR band at 1120 nm (epsilon = 3000 M-1 cm(-1)) are observed for the CH3CN solution. Reversible one-electron reduction and oxidation steps were studied by cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, EPR, and UV-vis-NIR spectroelectrochemistry to exhibit metal-centered oxidation and mixed metal/ligand-centered reduction. These results are supported by TD-DFT calculations of the species rac- or meso-1(n), n = 3+, 2+, +, 0, -, 2-.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T15:25:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T15:25:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 52(15)8467-8475</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic400390b</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15148</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
