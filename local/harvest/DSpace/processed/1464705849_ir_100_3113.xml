Photochemical sigmatropic 1,2-acyl shift (or oxa-di-pi-methane rearrangement) and 1,3-acyl shift in annulated bicyclo[2.2.2]octenones are the key features of this approach. An efficient one step synthesis of epoxy ketones 15-17 via pi(4)s+pi(2)s cycloaddition of in situ generated cyclohexa-2,4-dienone 11 has been reported. Further transformation of 15-17 and their congeners to a variety of chromophoric systems 22-31 has been described. The structure and stereochemistry of annulated bicyclo[2.2.2]octenones 15-31 has been established through their high field H-1-NMR (300MHz), C-13-NMR, decoupling experiments and cosy spectra. Photochemical behaviour of selected chromophoric systems upon tripler (T-3) and singlet (S-1) excitations has been investigated. While triplet excitation (T-3) of 23, 24, 26-28, 30-32 and 35 led to formation of tetracyclic systems 38-47, the singlet excitation (S-1) of 23, 24, 27, 28, 29b; 31b, 36 and 55 furnished the protoilludanoids 56-63. Interestingly, 29b did not undergo 1,2-acyl shift upon tripler excitation, but it underwent 1,3-acyl shift upon singlet excitation to give 60. Cleavage of cyclopropane ring in some of the tetracyclic products has also been investigated. Reductive cleavage of 38, 44, 46 and 47 to tricyclic systems 50-53 has also been reported.
