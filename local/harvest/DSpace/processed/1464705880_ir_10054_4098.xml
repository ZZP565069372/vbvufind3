The Te-2 compound (CO)(6)Fe-2{mu-TeC-(H)=C(H)Te) (4) was obtained in 32% yield from the reaction of (CO)(6)Fe-2(mu-Te-2) with acetylene. Compounds 1-4 were characterized by IR and H-1, C-13, Se-77, and Te-125 NMR spectroscopy. Crystallographic analysis of the phenylacetylene adducts (CO)(6)Fe-2{mu-SC(Ph)=C(H)Se} (5) and (CO)(6)Fe-2(CO)(6)Fe-2{mu-SC(H)=C(Ph)Te) (6) were carried out. The structures of both 5 and 6 can be described as Fe(2)SE (E = Se, Te) tetrahedral butterfly cores containing the phenylacetylene as a bridge between the two wingtip chalcogen atoms, with three terminally bonded carbonyl groups on each Fe atom.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-14T23:53:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-14T23:53:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ORGANOMETALLICS, 15(5), 1356-1361</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0276-7333</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/om950815u</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4098</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4098</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
