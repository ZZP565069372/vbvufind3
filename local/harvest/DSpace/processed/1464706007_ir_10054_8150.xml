Much work has focused on strategies for distributing requests across a Web server cluster in order to improve the overall throughput across the cluster. The strategies applied at the application layer are the same as those at the Web server layer because it is assumed that they transfer directly. In this paper, we argue that the problem of distributing requests across an application server cluster is fundamentally different from the Web server request distribution problem due to core differences in request processing in Web and application servers. We devise an approach for distributing requests across a cluster of application servers such that the overall system throughput is enhanced, and load across the application servers is balanced.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE COMPUTER SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-31T14:49:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:40:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-31T14:49:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:40:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, 18(11), 1516-1528</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1045-9219</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2007.1105</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8150</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8150</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
