Cast billets, of identical composition, were also extruded as reference material. Chip boundaries, visible even after 49: 1 extrusion at 400 degrees C, were observed to suppress grain coarsening. Although 250 degrees C extruded chip-consolidated product showed early onset of yielding and lower ductility, fully dense material (extruded at 400 degrees C) had nearly 40% reduction in grain size with 22% higher yield strength and comparable ductility as that of the reference. The study highlights the role of densification and grain refinement on the compression behavior of chip consolidated specimens.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:38:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:38:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH, 27(4)709-719</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1557/jmr.2011.411</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/16087</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
