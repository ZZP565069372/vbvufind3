There are several problems that create inaccuracies in guidance. Fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) have the ability to perform effectively even in situations where the information about the plant is inexact and the operating conditions are uncertain. A FLC based on the popular Proportional Navigation Guidance (PNG) law is proposed in this work. The FLC alters the value of the equivalent Navigational Constant to reap the maximum benefits in terms of the missile performance. The FLC is introduced into the guidance loop and the results are compared with those obtained with the conventional PNG law. It has been shown that the FLC needs lower peak acceleration and fuel than the conventional PNG law in all the cases under consideration even when noise and flight control system dynamics of the first order are introduced into the loop.
