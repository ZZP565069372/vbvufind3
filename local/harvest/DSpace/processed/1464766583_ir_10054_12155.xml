When compared with the Mishra et al. (2005) model based on variable source area (VSA) concept, the proposed model performed better in all applications. Both the models however exhibited a better match between the simulated and observed runoff in high runoff producing watersheds than did in low runoff producing catchments. Using the results of the proposed model, dominant/dormant processes involved in watershed's runoff generating mechanism have also been identified. The presented model is found useful in the continuous simulation of rainfall-runoff process in watersheds.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T18:14:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T18:14:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:49:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT, 22(2), 165-190</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0920-4741</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-006-9149-5</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12155</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12155</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
