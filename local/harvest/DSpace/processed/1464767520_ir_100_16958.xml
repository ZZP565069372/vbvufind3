Hall coefficient and hot probe technique in conjunction with thermopower measurements ascertain the conductivity type of the films to be changing from n- to p-type, as the film composition assessed by energy dispersive analysis of X-rays changed from In rich to Cu rich. The conductivity is found to be similar to 2.1 x 10(1) S/cm in In-rich n-type films where as it is similar to 1.13 x 10(2) S/cm in Cu-rich p-type films with a corresponding increase in carrier concentration and carrier mobility in the latter. Scanning electron micrographs show close assembling of nanograins and X-ray diffraction reveals a change in orientation of crystallites from (006) to (600) as the composition goes from In rich to Cu rich.
