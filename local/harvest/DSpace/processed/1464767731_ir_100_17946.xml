For a better understanding of residential indoor air pollution in Switzerland we conducted repeated 1-2-week-long indoor and outdoor measurements of particle number concentrations (PNC), particulate matter (PM), light absorbance of PM2.5 (PMabsorbance) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Residents of all homes were enrolled in the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA). Indoor levels were comparable in urban areas and generally low in rural homes. Average indoor levels were 7800 particles/cm3 (interquartile range= 7200); 8.7 mu g/m(3) (6.5) PM2.5 and 10.2 mu g/m(3) (11.2) NO2. All pollutants showed large variability of indoor/outdoor ratios between sites. We observed similar diurnal patterns for indoor and outdoor PNC. Nevertheless, the correlation of average indoor and outdoor PNC between sites as well as longitudinal indoor/outdoor correlations within sites were low. Our results show that a careful evaluation of home characteristics is needed when estimating indoor exposure to pollutants with outdoor origin.</dc:description><dc:publisher>NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:35:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:35:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, 25(5)499-505</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1559-0631</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1559-064X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jes.2015.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17946</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
