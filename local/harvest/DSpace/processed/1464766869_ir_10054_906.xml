The results suggest that signal amplification achieved by the cascade structure ensured that the modifying enzymes at various steps of the cascade were nearly saturated. Thus, there was no change in the response sensitivity with increasing upstream kinase concentration. Analysis was also extended to branching of a signaling pathway as an example of cross-talk. It was observed that the cascade structure confers a larger share of the signal transduction properties to its last kinase. This phenomenon in enzyme cascades may explain how the response of the terminal MAP kinase is unaffected by cross-talk of upstream kinases.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-03-09T07:44:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T18:51:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:06:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:54:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-03-09T07:44:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T18:51:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:06:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:54:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>FEBS Letters 558(1-3), 79-84</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0014-5793</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(04)00021-3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/906</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/906</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
