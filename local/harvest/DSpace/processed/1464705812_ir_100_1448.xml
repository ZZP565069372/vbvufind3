A set of knowledge-based rules, for assessing the soil erosion of the heterogeneous hilly watershed, were formulated from the knowledge of the multidisciplinary resource-experts and the knowledge of the local watershed characteristics, in addition to the field observations. This systems-approach model, which is hopefully fast, cost-effective and unaffected by individual bias, helped to infer the erosion intensity units that are most likely to occur at any given pixel in the system. Finally, the watershed was grouped into four different erosion intensity units namely: very severe, severe, moderate to severe and slight to moderate. A new integrated approach to identify priority/critical sub-watersheds by the Sediment Yield Index (SYI) model of the All India Soil and Land Use Survey (AIS&amp;LUS, 1991), grouped the watershed into very high, high, medium and low priority sub-watershed classes. The significant variation in SYI values calls for conservation planning in cases of very high and high priority classes. A treatment-oriented land-use planning scheme using GIS, was formulated and suggested bio-engineering measures to reduce soil erosion processes further. The soil erosion information system thus generated, identifies the targeted problem areas for watershed conservation planning and for sustainable development of the hilly watershed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INT ASSOC HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-20T17:39:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-20T17:39:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>MODELLING SOIL EROSION, SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AND CLOSELY RELATED HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,(249)143-148</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1-901502-50-3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0144-7815</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/14713</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/1448</dc:identifier><dc:source>International Symposium on Modelling Soil Erosion, Sediment Transport and Closely Related Hydrological Processes,VIENNA, AUSTRIA,JUL 13-17, 1998</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
