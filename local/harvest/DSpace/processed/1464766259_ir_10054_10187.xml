Composites and fibers were exposed to a mixed inoculum of aerobic bacteria and also to an anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria. Fiberglass-reinforced vinyl ester and isophthalic ester composites, as well as the individual glass fibers, were extensively degraded due to the bacterial attack. Degradation from exposure to water at elevated temperatures as well as exposure to IN sulfuric acid were studied. In both cases, the composite samples underwent degradation in the form of fiber pullout, as well as matrix cracking, leading to subsequent reduction in the mechanical properties.</dc:description><dc:publisher>NATL ASSN CORROSION ENG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-19T01:54:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-19T01:54:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:43:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MATERIALS PERFORMANCE, 36(5), 65-69</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0094-1492</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10187</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10187</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
