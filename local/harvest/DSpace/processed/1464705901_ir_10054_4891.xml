The experimental observations of bed voidage both for this study as well as for experimental data from a study  Trinet et al. for a three-phase FBBR compared reasonably well with the model predictions developed in this study, with mean deviations of 0.26% and 7%, respectively. Further, published experimental observations of bed voidage in a two-phase FBBR agreed well with the model predictions, with mean deviations of 26.4%, 5.2%, and 9.7% for studies conducted by Mulcahy and Shieh, Ngian and Martin, and Setiadi, respectively, and with a mean deviation of 18.7% for the total published experimental data (297 points) of the above researchers.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-18T11:01:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-18T11:01:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE, 126(6), 570-574</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0733-9372</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2000)126:6(570)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4891</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4891</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
