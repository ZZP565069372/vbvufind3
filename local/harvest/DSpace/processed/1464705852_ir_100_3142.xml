Introduction of new structural types of nitroxides has given rise to newer applications. Different types of nitroxides and the methods for the syntheses of these nitroxides are described. A brief account of the reactions of nitroxides is also presented. The article however does not provide a compendium of molecules which have been spin labeled. The literature appearing after 1980 has been emphasized. Recent developments in the field of spin labeling, using the nitroxide free radical as a biophysical tool, have been outlined.</dc:description><dc:publisher>COUNCIL SCIENTIFIC INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-15T07:32:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-15T07:32:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>1995</dc:date><dc:type>Review</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC &amp; INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH,54(11)623-636</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0022-4456</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/13950</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/3142</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
