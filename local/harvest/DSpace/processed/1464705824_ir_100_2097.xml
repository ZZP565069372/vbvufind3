The present study was undertaken to use anaerobic digestion as complete solution to treat BOD and COD in the same reactor in conjunction with suitable oxidation technique. Two such reactors, namely, Hybrid Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (HABR) and Granular Bed Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (GBABR) were used. The effluents from both the reactors were oxidized by using hydrogen peroxide. The oxidized spent wash was further fed into another set of HABR and GBABR reactors. An overall COD removal efficiency of 92% and 90% was achieved for HABR and GBABR, respectively.</dc:description><dc:publisher>WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-25T06:10:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-25T06:10:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>CBEE 2009: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2009 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING,51-54</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-981-4293-46-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/9789814295048_0011</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15625</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2097</dc:identifier><dc:source>International Conference on Chemical, Biological and Environmental Engineering (CBEE 2009),Singapore, SINGAPORE,OCT 09-11, 2009</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
