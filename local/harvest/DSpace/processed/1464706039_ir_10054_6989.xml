Herein, we report on the binding of a semi-essential amino acid, L-arginine, onto the surface of nano magnetite, creating a stable aqueous suspension by an in situ one-step method using sonochemical synthesis An ex situ two-step process was also attempted, but was soon discarded owing to the relative short duration of the suspension attributed to increase in particle size and lower extent of binding The initial concentration of the amino acid was found to play an important role in controlling the particle size and also the binding motif Lower concentrations of arginine were found to favor the formation of elongated tubular structures, while at higher concentrations, the elongated structures were less prominent and arginine was found to be adsorbed onto the surface of the magnetite This surface-functionalized nanomagnetite with amino acids could become a promising vehicle for drug delivery.
