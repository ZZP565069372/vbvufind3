One such microstructure called “myelin,” which is observed when a surfactant like phosphatidylcholine is contacted with water, is the subject of this paper. In this study we have used video microscopy to investigate myelin growth over a wide time range, namely 0.25–700 s, and found that existing models do not correctly express myelin growth over extended time ranges. When studied over a wide time range, the myelin growth was found to evolve over three distinct regimes, namely ballistic, diffusional, and subdiffusional regimes. The underlying growth models are physically explained and mathematically expressed. A relationship is derived between the width of myelin and the growth rate at long times. The estimated width of myelin is consistent with experiments.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-02-14T07:23:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T16:49:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:05:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-02-14T07:23:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T16:49:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:05:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Journal of Colloid and Interface Science 289(1), 242-248</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0021-9797</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2005.01.004</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/638</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/638</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
