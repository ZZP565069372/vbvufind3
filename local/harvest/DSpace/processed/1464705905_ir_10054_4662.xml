Recent efforts in trying to increase the strength of composites have been directed towards increasing the strength of the interface through fiber surface treatment and better resin systems that give better interfacial shear strength. However, the role of frictional forces and analysis of twisted impregnated yams have largely been ignored. Twisted geometry gives rise to lateral pressure that contributes to the frictional shear stress; therefore, for a twisted yam, interfacial shear strength would be higher than that of a impregnated strand/unidirectional composite. Twisted yams have the obvious disadvantage that their unidirectional strength suffers because of fiber obliquity. This work examines the effect of the lateral pressure on the tensile strength of twisted yams with broken filaments. Studies have been carried out on both the helical wound impregnated yams and helical twisted impregnated yams.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER SOC TESTING MATERIALS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-17T07:51:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-17T07:51:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES TECHNOLOGY &amp; RESEARCH, 23(3), 225-234</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0884-6804</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4662</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4662</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
