The assembly process is revealed to be independent of the expression host, while dimensions and level of order of the assembled structures were influenced by the host organism. An additional level of interactions, namely, coalescence between the preformed SMPAs, was observed during the purification process. SAXS investigation revealed that upon coalescence, the local order of the individual SMPAs was preserved. Finally, the chaotropic agent urea effectively disrupted both the macroscopic coalescence and the interactions at the nanoscale until the level of the single ferritin cage.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:02:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-15T06:02:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>BIOMACROMOLECULES, 16(7)2006-2011</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1525-7797</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1526-4602</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.5b00435</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17881</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
