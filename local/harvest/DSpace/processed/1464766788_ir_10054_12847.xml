Reaction of 2,6-diisopropylphenyl dillydrogen phosphate (dipp-H(2)) with ferrous acetate under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of mononuclear, [Fe(II)(dipp-H)(2)(py)(4)] (1) (py=pyridine), dinuclear [Fe(2)(III)O(dipp-H)(4)(3,5-dmpz)(3) (thf)]center dot(3,5-dmpz)center dot(thf)(3) (2) (3,5-dmpz= 3,5-dimethylpyrazole, thf=tetrahydrofuran), and trinuclear [Fe(2)(III)Fe(II)O(dipp-H)(6)(thf)(3)].(collidine) (3) complexes by changing the ancillary amine used in the reaction. Use of a preformed mu(3)- oxo bridged trinuclear complex, [Fe(3)(III)O(O(2)CR)(6)(H(2)O)(3)]X (X=Cl and NO(3)), as the precursor yielded two tetranuclear iron phosphates, [Fe(4)(III)O-(dipp)(3)(py)(4)(PhCOO)(4)].(toluene)(3) (4) and [Fe(4)(III)O(diPP)(3)(OAc)(4)(py)(4)] center dot (py)(2) (5), having a core structure similar to those found in tetranuclear iron phosphonates. When FeCl(3)center dot 6H(2)O was used as the iron precursor, an unprecedented pentanuclear iron phosphate complex, [Fe(5)(III)O(dipp)(6)(py)(4)Cl(2)][pyH] (6) with a novel structure was isolated. Another pentanuclear complex having a similar core structure, [Fe(5)O(dipp)(6) (HO(2)CPh)(3)(CH(3)CN)(3)Cl] (7) was isolated on treatment of dipp-H(2) with the triangular complex, [Fe(3)(III)O(O(2)CPh)(6) (H(2)O)(3)]Cl in the absence of any added airline co-ligand. Compounds 1-7 have been characterized by analytical techniques, spectroscopic studies, single crystal X-ray diffraction studies, and magnetic measurements. The Mossbauer studies carried out at room temperature Support the formulation of all the compounds.</dc:description><dc:publisher>WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-09-01T19:05:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-09-01T19:05:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>CHEMISTRY-AN ASIAN JOURNAL, 4(6), 923-935</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1861-4728</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asia.200800474</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12847</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12847</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
