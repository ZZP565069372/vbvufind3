In the present study, the SND based SBR system was used to carry out total nitrogen removal at reduced aeration (DO = 2 mg/L) using a specifically designed single sludge biomass containing Thiosphaera pantotropha. The concentration of each of the nitrophenols was gradually increased from 2.5 to 200 mg/L during acclimation. The nitrophenols were used as the sole source of nitrogen during study. A synthetic feed was designed to direct SND in the bioreactors. It was observed that overall removal for 4-NP was 98% and for 2,4-DNP and 2,4,6 TNP, removals varied between 83% and 84%. The COD removal for 4-NP was 99% and for 2,4-DNP and 2,4,6-TNP was 97-98% during acclimation. Total nitrogen and nitrophenol removals were achieved via SND. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
