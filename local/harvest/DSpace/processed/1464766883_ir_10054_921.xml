We incorporate a more general reaction scheme as well as polymer phase separation both by nucleation of the polymer-rich phase as well as by spinodal decomposition. The model predictions are verified against experimental data for unstirred Nylon 6â€“10 system. The model predicts that spinodal decomposition is the dominant mechanism of polymer phase separation at short reaction times. Film growth by nucleation of the polymer-rich phase dominates at larger times. The model also predicts the dominance of the nucleation mode of film growth with dilution of the organic phase. This model provides a further step towards a rational design and prediction of properties of membranes/capsules produced by interfacial polymerization.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-03-09T07:48:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T18:59:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-03-09T07:48:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T18:59:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Chemical Engineering Science 53(15), 2649-2663</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0009-2509</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0009-2509(98)00083-9</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/921</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/921</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
