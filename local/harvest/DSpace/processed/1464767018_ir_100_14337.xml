This air flow, in turn, determines the wood-burning rate as well as the overall thermal and combustion efficiencies. The flow and associated heat/mass transfer and combustion phenomena are 3-dimensional and time dependent. In this paper, a simplified 4-zone well-stirred thermochemical model is developed by capturing steady-state effects of chemical reaction kinetics of char and volatile burning. The model predicts performance parameters such as thermal efficiency, composition of combustion products, and excess-air factors for an experimental stove. Effects of stove geometry, wood fuel characteristics, cooking vessel dimensions, and other ambient conditions are investigated.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-06-26T09:53:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-06-26T09:53:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,183(4)321-346</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0010-2202</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00102202.2010.516617</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14337</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
