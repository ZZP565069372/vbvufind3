Monthly measurements of gaseous and particulate pollutants were made at six monitoring stations from January 1997 to December 2000. Meteorological data was also simultaneously collected. In this study, the relationship between monitored ambient air quality data and meteorological factors, such as wind speed, temperature, is statistically analysed, using the SPSS package. The monthly mean, concentrations of NOx, SO2 and TSP were in the range of 19.5-59.0 mug/m(3), 8.6-51.3 mug/m(3) and 88.2-199.3 mug/m(3), respectively. The results show that TSP is strongly con-elated with NOx, and SO2 with a correlation coefficient of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively. The correlation coefficients for TSP, NOx, and SO2 with wind are -0.78, -0.78, and -0.88, respectively.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-01T20:30:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-01T20:30:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:39:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION, 21(3), 253-262</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0957-4352</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJEP.2004.004193</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8537</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8537</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
