Conventional oedometer tests were performed to determine the swelling characteristics of montmorillonite and bentonite clay minerals corresponding to various molding water contents, maintaining the same dry density. With the help of a dew point potentiameter, which can be used for measuring very high suction (congruent to 90 MPa), the suction of these minerals was measured. The results obtained were used to correlate suction with the swelling pressure and the correlation was validated using data reported in the literature. The study demonstrates the usefulness of the methodology for quickly determining the swelling pressure of various clay minerals and soils.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER SOC TESTING MATERIALS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-17T08:46:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-17T08:46:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION, 33(4), 239-245</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0090-3973</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4678</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4678</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
