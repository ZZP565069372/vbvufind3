The output is driven by a ve bar mechanism, which, in turn, is driven by a servo input and a reference input. By choosing the correct trajectories of the servo input and the starting position, the torque sharing characteristics can be improved, such that the lowest rating servomotor will suface. Thus providing exibitity at A reduced cost. Also the reference input which can be a constant speed motion can be derived from some other source, thus not needing a dedicated motor. Such a device can replace cams in applications where the functional relationship between the input and the output motions changes from time to time, such as packaging equipment and control of valve timings of IC engines. The PHM setup has been designed and fabricated. Simulation of the mechanism is carried out using ADAMS, to determine the size of servo motor. An approach to determine optimal control input to the mechanism for a given output pro le is discussed. The experimental setup allows users to generate various cam pro les and study the deviations. Various pro les were generated within reasonable accuracy. A typical cam pro le has been considered and optimization of control trajectory results in RMS torque reduction of 57%.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T18:11:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T18:11:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>2004 IEEE CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS, AUTOMATION AND MECHATRONICS, VOLS 1 AND 2,607-612</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-8645-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16084</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2671</dc:identifier><dc:source>IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics,Singapore, SINGAPORE,DEC 01-03, 2004</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
