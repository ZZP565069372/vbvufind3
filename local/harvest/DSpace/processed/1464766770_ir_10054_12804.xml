CD7 has been demonstrated to generate, like other costimulatory molecules, intracellular signals that modulate T cell function. However, although it binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), the signaling events mediated by CD7 are not completely understood. In this context, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI 4-kinase) is a key enzyme involved in a variety of events, from the modeling of the actin cytoskeleton to the activation of protein kinase C. In this study, we show for the first time that PI 4-kinase of 55 kDa can associate with CD7. The enzyme activity was insensitive to wortmannin, but was inhibited by adenosine, a characteristic for type II PI 4-kinase. Together, our findings demonstrate that type II PI 4-kinases are integral components of the CD7 signaling pathway and may play a role of CD7 in co-stimulation and thymic differentiation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-09-01T14:55:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-09-01T14:55:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY, 33(1), 46-52</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0014-2980</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/immu.200390006</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12804</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12804</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
