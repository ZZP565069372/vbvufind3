Studies were carried out on tensile Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) apparatus in the strain rate range of 140-400/s. For comparison, quasi-static properties were also generated on a universal testing machine. An increase of 75-93% was observed in through the thickness high strain rate tensile strength compared with quasi-static tensile strength. In the range of strain rate considered, as the strain rate was increased, the tensile strength increased up to 11% along the thickness direction. An increase of 63-88% was observed in high strain rate tensile strength along the fill compared with quasi-static tensile strength. In the range of strain rate considered, as the strain rate was increased, the tensile strength increased up to 16% along the fill direction. Since the plain weave fabric used was balanced, the properties along warp and fill are nearly identical.
