These catalysts were examined by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction. Reduction of the supported iron salts was difficult irrespective of the pretreatment, and cobalt was easier to reduce if it was not oxidised prior to reduction. Reduction of iron in the bimetallics is easier due to the presence of cobalt. Titania interacts more strongly with the oxides of iron and cobalt making it difficult to reduce them.</dc:description><dc:publisher>COUNCIL SCIENTIFIC INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-21T01:47:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-21T01:47:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:38:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>1992</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDIAN JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY, 30(2), 81-84</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0019-5669</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5734</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5734</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
