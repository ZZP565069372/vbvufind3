Lifting has been shown to be very effective in developing strong valid inequalities for linear integer programming and it has been successfully used to solve such problems with branch-and-cut algorithms. Here we generalize the theory of lifting to conic integer programming, i.e., integer programs with conic constraints. We show how to derive conic valid inequalities for a conic integer program from conic inequalities valid for its lower-dimensional restrictions. In order to simplify the computations, we also discuss sequence- independent lifting for conic integer programs. When the cones are restricted to nonnegative orthants, conic lifting reduces to the lifting for linear integer programming as one may expect.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-06-26T05:20:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-06-26T05:20:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING,126(2)351-363</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0025-5610</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10107-009-0282-9</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/13953</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
