The potential of the cationic L to differentiate nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) from their mono- and diphosphates was demonstrated. Due to its unique combination of arms with the calix-platform, a fluorescence enhancement was observed for L with all the NTPs, whereas there is no report with such enhancement being exhibited in case of all the NTPs. This has been supported by the aggregation of L observed from microscopy. Selectivity of L towards NTPs over other phosphates was a result of specific weak interactions, namely, ion-ion, hydrogen bonding and , present in the 1:2 complex of L and NTPs (based on ESI MS), which were absent in their congener-phosphates as delineated by NMR and computational studies. Thus, L stands as a unique receptor for NTPs.</dc:description><dc:publisher>WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-28T12:44:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-28T12:44:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL, 20(44)14378-14386</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0947-6539</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1521-3765</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chem.201403353</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/16585</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
