The crack is modelled by a rotational spring and the flexural vibration problem is formulated. This gives rise to a relationship involving the spring stiffness, location of crack and natural frequency. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by numerical experiments with a three span beam with end supports and a crack located either in the first or second span. The method is accurate up to 5% for a crack size more than 10% section depth and located away from the supports. The method does not require much iteration.</dc:description><dc:publisher>PERGAMON PRESS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-27T12:33:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-27T12:33:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>ADVANCES IN FRACTURE RESEARCH, VOLS 1-6,2603-2610</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-08-042820-7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16299</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2801</dc:identifier><dc:source>9th International Conference in Fracture (ICF9),SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA,APR 01-05, 1997</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
