This paper presents a microdevice enabling blood plasma separation. In the present work, the microfluidic channel was innovatively designed in such a way that a combination of effects such as Fahraeus effect, bifurcation law, cell-free region, centrifugal action, and constriction-expansion is utilized together for skimming plasma from human blood. Microdevices were designed and fabricated using PDMS (poly-di-methyl siloxane), which is a bio-compatible material. The results obtained are extremely encouraging in terms of separation efficiency. Separation efficiency of almost 100 % has been achieved at moderate hematocrit contents of around 20 %. The separation efficiency for undiluted blood (hematocrit of 45 %) is around 80 %. This microdevice is free from clogging issues that are usually encountered in blood plasma separation devices.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER HEIDELBERG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2016-01-14T11:08:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2016-01-14T11:08:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MICROFLUIDICS AND NANOFLUIDICS, 18(42130)995-1006</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1613-4982</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1613-4990</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10404-014-1488-6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17437</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
