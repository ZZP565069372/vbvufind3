A (lambda, C)-fragmented coloring of a graph G is an assignment of a color from {0, ..., lambda - 1} to each vertex of G such that every connected component in the graph induced by vertices of a single color has at most C vertices. For proper interval graphs, we give linear time and nearly linear time algorithms for the problems of minimizing lambda given C, and minimizing C given lambda. We also consider versions in which each vertex has a weight, and the sum of the weights in each induced connected component must be at most C. We give nearly linear time algorithms for the splittable weighted version and a 2-approximation for the non-splittable weighted version, all on proper interval graphs. We also prove that even the unweighted version is NP-hard for split graphs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
