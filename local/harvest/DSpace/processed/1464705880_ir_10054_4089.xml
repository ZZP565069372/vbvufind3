Spectroscopic (NMR, ESR, and UV-vis) monitoring shows selective and total reduction of MB+, Saf(+), and MV2+ to MBH, SafH, and MV+ respectively, accompanied by conversion of [Pt-12(CO)(24)](2-) to [Pt-9(CO)(18)](2-). No BNAH (analogue and model for NADH) is formed in the reaction of [BNA](2)[Pt-12(CO)(24)] with dihydrogen. However, in the reactions of BNA(+)Cl(-), [Saf](2)[Pt-12(CO)(24)], and dihydrogen, BNAH is formed in small quantities in DMSO and quantitatively in a biphasic system (water and dichloromethane). The redox behaviors of MB+, Saf(+), MV2+, and BNA(+) as chloride salts have also been studied in DMF by cyclic voltammetry, and the data have been used to rationalize some of the observed reactions. The dihydrogen-driven, [Bu4N](2)[Pt-12(CO)(24)]-catalyzed transport of A(+) (A(divided by) = MB+, Saf(+)) as AH through a liquid membrane has also been studied.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-14T22:54:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-14T22:54:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ORGANOMETALLICS, 23(15), 3733-3740</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0276-7333</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/om049833e</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4089</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4089</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
