This restricts their use to long-term applications only. This paper describes how such data can be made suitable for short-term usage in the field. Weekly mean significant wave heights were derived from their monthly mean observations with the help of different alternative techniques. These include model-free neural network schemes as well as model-based statistical and numerical methods. Superiority of neural networks was noted when the estimations were compared with corresponding observations. The network was trained using three different training algorithms, viz., error back propagation, conjugate gradient and cascade correlation. The technique of cascade correlation took minimum training time and showed better coefficient of correlation between observations and network output.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-03-23T09:45:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T20:20:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:08:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:56:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-03-23T09:45:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T20:20:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:08:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:56:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Ocean Engineering 27(9), 907-919</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0029-8018</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0029-8018(99)00023-2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1089</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1089</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
