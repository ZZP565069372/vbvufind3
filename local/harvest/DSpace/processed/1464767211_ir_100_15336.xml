In these memory devices, the memory window was found to be 6.10V and the obtained charge loss was only 15.20% after 10(5) s. The superior retention characteristics and a wide memory window are achieved due to presence of ZnO quantum dots between tunneling and control oxide layers. Room temperature Coulomb blockade effect was found in these devices and it was ascertained to be the main reason for low leakage. Electronic band diagram with program and erase operations were described on the basis of electrical characterizations.
