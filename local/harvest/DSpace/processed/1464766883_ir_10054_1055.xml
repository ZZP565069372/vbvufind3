Characterization and performance of this coating was carried out by a round-robin test at various laboratories. About 300 samples, prepared at Spire, USA, were distributed to 10 different laboratories. Characterization of coated materials, carried out using Rutherford backscattering (RBS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), glancing X-ray diffraction, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), confirmed a well-adherent layer of chromium nitride with composition and thickness of Cr0.8N0.2 and 1.2 Î¼m, respectively. The performance of the coating was tested by tribological tests: dynamic micro-indentation, micro-hardness, wear and friction, and corrosion tests. The coating was found to be hard with good wear resistance and had enhanced resistance to corrosion in acid media.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-03-23T05:11:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T20:03:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-03-23T05:11:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-25T20:03:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:07:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:55:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Applied Surface Science 156(1-4), 47-64</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0169-4332</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0169-4332(99)00350-5</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1055</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1055</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
