The sensor, developed at the Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research, is a conducting polymer film coated with Pd on either side. One side of the sensor was exposed to an argon-hydrogen gas mixture and the other side to air. The current flowing through the sensor was directly proportional to the hydrogen content in the gas mixture. Hydrogen measurements were also carried out by gas chromatography and one to one correspondence between the results from the gas chromatography and the new sensor was obtained. In addition to these results, advantages of the new sensor over presently available methods for measurement of diffusible hydrogen and its limitations are also discussed in this paper.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER WELDING SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-17T09:14:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-17T09:14:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>WELDING JOURNAL, 76(7), S251-S255</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0043-2296</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4683</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4683</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
