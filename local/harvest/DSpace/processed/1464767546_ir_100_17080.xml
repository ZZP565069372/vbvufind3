Providing high playability on such devices concurrently is difficult. To enhance the gaming experience, designers could leverage abundant and elastic cloud resources, but current cloud platforms aren't optimized for highly interactive games. Existing studies focus on streaming-based cloud gaming, which is a special case for the more general cloud game architecture. The authors explain how to integrate techniques from the cloud and game research communities into a complete architecture for enhanced online gaming quality.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE COMPUTER SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-29T04:30:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-29T04:30:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IEEE INTERNET COMPUTING, 18(3)20-27</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1089-7801</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1941-0131</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/17080</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
