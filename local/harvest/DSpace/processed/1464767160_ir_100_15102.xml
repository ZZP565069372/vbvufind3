Subsequent rapid thermal annealing at 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C was performed to remove defects resulting from the irradiation (samples B and C, respectively). Atomic force microscopy was used to determine the root mean square roughness, which was 10.07, 8.66, and 9.31 nm for samples A, B, and C, respectively. Low-temperature photoluminescence measurements revealed increased deep-level defect peaks following irradiation; however, the subsequent annealing minimized the defects. Although the dominant donor-bound exciton peak verifies the n-type conductivity of the films, the free-electron-to-acceptor and donor-to-acceptor pair peaks in the irradiated samples confirm an increase in acceptor concentration.
