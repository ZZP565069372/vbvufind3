The chemical structure and interface roughness were characterized by measuring X-ray reflectivity. Polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) was performed on selected samples at magnetic saturation, and the spin dependent reflectivities were analysed by modelling the magnetic states of the soft and hard FeCoV layers. PNR suggests the existence of two magnetic phases of FeCoV, i.e, in the bulk and at the interface. The extent of these two regions and their magnetic moments for various Ti thicknesses were estimated from PNR and are utilized to understand the magnetization reversal of these multilayers.
