Literature study shows that under low flow conditions, the velocity field near the wall is significantly modified by secondary convection currents particularly during diabatic conditions. In view of this, the applicability of conventional forced convection wall constitutive laws to these systems has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. First the applicability of conventional wall constitutive laws derived from steady state forced convection experiments is examined. Next, the results of experimental investigations carried out in a rectangular natural circulation loop are presented. Finally, a new correlation for wall friction factor is proposed for flow in horizontal pipes under diabatic conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
