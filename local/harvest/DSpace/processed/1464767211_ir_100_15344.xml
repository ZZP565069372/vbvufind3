Next, (S)-BuNA nucleotides were incorporated in DNA strands and their effect on duplex stability and changes in structural conformation were investigated. Circular dichroism (CD), UV-melting and non-denatured gel electrophoresis (native PAGE) studies revealed that (S)-BuNA is capable of making duplexes with its complementary strands and integration of (S)-BuNA nucleotides into DNA duplex does not alter the B-type-helical structure of the duplex. Furthermore, (S)-BuNA oligonucleotides and (S)-BuNA substituted DNA strands were studied as primer extensions by DNA polymerases. This study revealed that the acyclic scaffold is tolerated by enzymes and is therefore to some extent biocompatible.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T05:32:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T05:32:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ORGANIC &amp; BIOMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY, 11(35)5853-5865</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1477-0520</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1477-0539</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ob41244j</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15344</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
