Manufacturing strategy literature lacks empirical research in manufacturing decision areas. The current paper is an exploratory study using six case companies on alternative configurations that can exist in a batch production system. Choices made in decisions such as layout, shop floor control, etc., were found to be similar for all six companies that use batch process. However, there were a number of decisions that were found to be non-process specific and are influenced by product complexity, important competitive priorities, strategic orientation of manufacturing, top management decisions and the size of the company. The paper concludes with managerial implications and future research directions.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T15:20:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T15:20:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH, 50(14)3698-3717</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2011.576276</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15887</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
