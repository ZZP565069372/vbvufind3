Initially, reactor R1 (control) and reactor R2 (test) containing TCA were operated at 5 different Hydraulic Retention Times (HRTs) of 36, 30, 24, 18 and 12 hours. TCA removal decreased from 99.8% to 96.5%, when the HRT was reduced from 36 to 12 hours in discrete steps. Later, when the OLR was varied periodically from 1.5 to 3.1 kg COD/m(3).d to obtain a different substrate: co-substrate ratios; lower TCA removal efficiencies were observed at an OLR of 2.5 kg COD/ m(3).d and above. The average effluent concentrations of TCA and COD were 0.12 and 79 mg/L, respectively, at the optimum HRT of 24 hours; whereas the effluent TCA and COD concentrations at the substrate: co-substrate ratio of 50:1 was 0.06 mg/L and 48 mg/L, respectively.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:03:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-17T05:03:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, 47(2)267-273</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2012.640902</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/16018</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
