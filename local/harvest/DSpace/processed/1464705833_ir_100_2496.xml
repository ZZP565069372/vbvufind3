Measuring such a small deviation is always being a challenge due to noise. An advanced and reliable Delta R/R measurement scheme is presented in this paper which can sense resistance changes down to 6 parts per million. The measurement scheme includes the half-bridge connected micro-cantilevers with mismatch compensation, precision op-amp based filters and amplifiers, and a lock-in amplifier based detector. The input actuating sine wave is applied from a function generator and the output dc voltage is displayed on a digital multimeter. The calibration is performed and instrument sensitivity is calculated. An experimental set-up using a probe station is discussed that demonstrates a combined performance of the measurement system and SU8-polysilicon cantilevers. The deflection sensitivity of such polymeric cantilevers is calculated. The system will be highly useful to detect bio-markers such as myoglobin and troponin that are released in blood during or after heart attacks.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-25T21:33:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-25T21:33:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>EMBC: 2009 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-20,3794-3797</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-1-4244-3295-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15826</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2496</dc:identifier><dc:source>Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society,Minneapolis, MN,SEP 03-06, 2009</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
