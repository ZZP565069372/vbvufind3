Nanoparticles are formed in an argon plasma using iron pentacarbonyl Fe(CO)(5) as a precursor. These particles are trapped in a pure argon plasma by shutting off the precursor and then coated with carbon by passing acetylene along with argon as the main background gas. Characterization of the particles was carried out using TEM for morphology, XPS for elemental composition and PPMS for magnetic properties. Iron nanoparticles obtained were a mixture of FeO and Fe(3)O(4). TEM analysis shows an average size of 7-14 nm for uncoated particles and 15-24 nm for coated particles. The effect of the carbon coating on magnetic properties of the nanoparticles is studied in detail.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-06-26T05:53:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-06-26T05:53:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH,13(9)3825-3833</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1388-0764</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11051-011-0305-3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/13978</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
