The change in river course and growth and erosion of the island/sand bar were measured. The palaeocourse of the river at test sites has been reconstructed. The measured cut-off ratio indicates that the chute cut-off of the river course near Gannavaram is very high. Flood affected areas in the regions could be assessed by this method.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS LTD LONDON</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-31T07:40:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:51:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-31T07:40:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:51:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>1995</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING, 16(13), 2393-2401</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0143-1161</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12634</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12634</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
