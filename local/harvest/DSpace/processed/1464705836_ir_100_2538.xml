Most of these proposals can be implemented quickly and often efficiently in software. We wish to use personal computers as forwarders in a network to utilize the advances made by researchers. We therefore examine the ability of a personal computer to act as a router. We analyze the performance of a single general purpose computer and show that I/O is the primary bottleneck. We then study the performance of distributed router composed of multiple general purpose computers. We study the performance of a star topology and through experimental results we show that although its performance is good, it lacks flexibility in its design. We compare it with a multistage architecture. We conclude with a proposal for an architecture that provides us with a forwarder that is both flexible and scalable.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-25T23:51:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-25T23:51:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HIGH PERFORMANCE SWITCHING AND ROUTING (HPSR),135-140</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-1-4244-1981-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15850</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2538</dc:identifier><dc:source>International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR 2008),Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA,MAY 15-17, 2008</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
