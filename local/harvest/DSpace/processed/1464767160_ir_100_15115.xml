Binding properties of L toward different biologically relevant metal ions have been studied by fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy in ethanol. L exhibits selective recognition of Co2+ and can detect down to a concentration of 55 ppb (0.92 mu M). The roles of the calix[4]arene platform as well as the preorganized binding core in L's selective recognition have been demonstrated by studying appropriate control molecules. The mode of binding of L with Co2+ has been modeled both by DFT and MD computational calculations. L and its Co2+ complex could be differentiated on the basis of the nanostructural features observed in AFM and TEM.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T15:06:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T15:06:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 78(8)3570-3576</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jo400038x</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15115</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
