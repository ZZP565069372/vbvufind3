The distance from the tryptophanyl residue has been ascertained by FRET from Trp to the chlorins and has been found to indicate a binding to Sudlow's Site i. The principal driving force for the interaction is found to be the hydrophobic effect. The main mechanism of protein fluorescence quenching was static. Time-resolved fluorescence results of competitive binding with warfarin are found to confirm that they bind to the warfarin binding site.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-14T21:41:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-14T21:41:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:47:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B, 111(35), 10557-10562</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1520-6106</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp072544u</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4076</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4076</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
