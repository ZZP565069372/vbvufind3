Phenylacetylene, 4-fluorophenylacetylene, 2-fluorophenylacetylene and 4-cyanophenylacetylene form quasi-planar cyclic complexes with water incorporating C-H center dot center dot center dot O and O-H center dot center dot center dot pi hydrogen bonds. In the case of phenylacetylene, 4-fluorophenylacetylene and 2-fluorophenylacetylene complexes the pi electron density of the acetylenic Ca parts per thousand C bond acts as an acceptor to the O-H center dot center dot center dot pi hydrogen bond, while in the case of 4-cyanophenylacetylene complex it's the pi electron density of the Ca parts per thousand N bond is the acceptor. A second water complex was also observed for 2-fluorophenylacetylene in which water interacts with fluorine atom and acetylenic Ca parts per thousand C bond rendering a double donor motif for the water molecule. One of the most interesting features of water complexes of 4-fluorophenylacetylene and 2-fluorophenylacetylene is the preference of pi hydrogen bond over sigma hydrogen bond.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INDIAN ASSOC CULTIVATION SCIENCE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T17:02:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T17:02:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS, 86(3)173-179</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12648-012-0034-1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15277</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
