Knowledge of environmental and organizational strengths and weaknesses is of vital importance in a strategic planning system. Expert Strategic Planner (ESP) addresses these issues during the strategic planning process. The detailed function and role of ESP are explained along with its proposed architecture. A chunk-based organization for knowledge and a message-passing locomotion for navigation are proposed. Inferencing is done through generation of figures of merit from knowledge and learning. A few illustrations are included. An application for ESP is also discussed. ESP, a stand-alone knowledge-based, strategic planning system, is ideally suited for determining the strategic objectives in the Intelligent System for Productivity Management (ISPM) proposed by the authors.</dc:description><dc:publisher>PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-24T07:19:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:56:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:46:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-24T07:19:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:56:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:46:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>1992</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS, 4(1), 99-115</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0957-4174</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0957-4174(92)90045-T</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/10800</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/10800</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
