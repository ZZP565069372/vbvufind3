In this paper, issues related to the area-energy targeting for fired heater integrated heat exchanger networks are studied. Performance of a fired heater is affected by the variables such as fuel fired and air-preheat temperature. These variables along with the minimum approach temperature difference for the heat recovery of the background process, affect the performance of the overall system. A methodology is proposed for the area-energy targeting for fired heater integrated processes. In the proposed methodology, the fired heater heat duty split between the radiation and the convection section is determined using the one gas zone furnace model.
