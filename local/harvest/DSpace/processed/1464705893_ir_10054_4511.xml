Results thus obtained are in very good agreement with the experiments. In particular, for the case of Li(2)O, we resolve a controversy originating in the experiment of Osaka and Shindo [Solid State Commun. 51, 421 (1984)] who had predicted the effective charge of Li ions to be in the range of 0.58-0.61, a value much smaller compared to its nominal value of unity, thereby, suggesting that the bonding in the material could be partially covalent. We demonstrate that effective charge computed by Osaka and Shindo is the Szigeti charge, and once the Born charge is computed, it is in excellent agreement with our computed value. Mulliken population analysis of Li(2)O also confirms ionic nature of the bonding in the substance.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER PHYSICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-16T19:28:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-16T19:28:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>PHYSICAL REVIEW B, 77(7), -</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1098-0121</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.77.075130</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4511</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4511</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
