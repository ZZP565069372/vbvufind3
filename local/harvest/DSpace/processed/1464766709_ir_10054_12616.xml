The prepared powders were characterised by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmer-Teller specific surface area measurements. Defect centres induced by radiation were studied using the techniques of thermoluminescence (TL) and electron spin resonance (ESR). A well-resolved glow with peak at 178 degrees C and a shouldered peak at 120 degrees C were observed. Two defect centres were identified by ESR measurements, which were carried out at room temperature, and these were assigned to an O- ion and F+ centre. The O- ion (hole centre) appears to correlate with the main TL peak at 178 degrees C.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-31T06:44:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:51:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-31T06:44:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:51:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE, 90(12), 1567-1574</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1478-6435</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786430903413367</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12616</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12616</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
