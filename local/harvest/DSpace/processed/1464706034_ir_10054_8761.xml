The suspensions were stabilized by a dispersant composed of fixed ratios of citric acid and triethylamine. Different quantities of the dispersants were used for a given amount of solid loading and the optimal amount was determined by measuring their zeta potential. Suspension stabilized by using the optimal dispersant amount was used for deposition on stainless steel substrates at different voltages for varying times. The optimal voltage and time was determined by observing obtained microstructures under SEM. Similar studies were then done for a lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) substrate. The optimal composition of suspensions and the used parameters made it possible to obtain coatings with uniform thickness.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INDIAN CERAMIC SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-02T10:25:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:40:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-02T10:25:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:53:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:40:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>TRANSACTIONS OF THE INDIAN CERAMIC SOCIETY, 68(2), 95-98</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0371-750X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/8761</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/8761</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
