At the same time, the imposition of stricter discharge regulations has caused an increase in the effluent treatment costs, which implies capital expenditure with little or no return. Process water management can be divided into two distinct activities: minimization of freshwater requirement and optimal treatment of wastewater generated from the process. Applying the concept of regeneration and recycling of wastewater in the process, freshwater requirement can be reduced significantly while satisfying environmental regulations. Graphical representation, as well as analytical algorithms, are proposed to address integrated process water management issues that involve regeneration and recycle through a single treatment unit.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-15T04:51:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-15T04:51:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:35:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDUSTRIAL &amp; ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH, 47(4), 1111-1119</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0888-5885</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie0712232</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4158</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4158</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
