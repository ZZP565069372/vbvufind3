The disposed off waste in the due course of time interacts with rainwater and contaminates the ground water resource. Such a situation calls for proper understanding and modeling of the long-term performance of these wastes and their transport through the porous media. With this in view, an attempt was made to model advective-diffusive transport of a non-reactive contaminant (chloride ion) through the unsaturated silty soil, in a geotechnical centrifuge. The results were compared with those obtained from the finite element analysis using SEEPAV and CTRAN/W, and an excellent matching between the results has been noted.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-22T13:09:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-22T13:09:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>UNSATURATED SOILS: NUMERICAL AND THEORETICAL APPROACHES,94,305-312</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>3-540-21122-5</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0930-8989</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/14904</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/1743</dc:identifier><dc:source>International Conference From Experimental Evidence towards Numerical Modeling of Unsaturated Soils,Weimar, GERMANY,SEP 18-19, 2003</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
