Ground-water head and flux in the underlying aquifer system were calculated for the rectangular basin. In addition, head distributions also were computed for circular, square, hexagonal, and triangular recharge basins with equal area and for the same recharge rate as the rectangular basin. A lower ground-water mound buildup was found for higher-perimeter basin shapes and vice versa. Influence of variation in hydraulic conductivity beneath the recharge basin due to gradual clogging of the aquifer pore spaces was investigated and the mass balance for the rectangular basin was checked. Time variant analysis computed a time of 82.3 days to stabilize the mound. The buildup was higher initially followed by a much slower growth as steady state was approached.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-18T12:49:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-18T12:49:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING, 3(1), 62-68</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1084-0699</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(1998)3:1(62)</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4922</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4922</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
