In this paper we propose a novel Adaptive Weighted Aggregation Scheme (AdWAS) for star as well as tree topology. We compare the performance of the proposed adaptive weighted aggregation scheme with existing one hit non-adaptive aggregation schemes. In non-adaptive schemes, a slight variation in the topology or performance indices necessitate recalculation of the initial setup. However, in the proposed adaptive scheme we just need to fine tune the weights starting from the previously adapted weights to compensate for any small variation in the topology. Moreover, there is hardly any performance degradation when using AdWAS. This clearly makes the adaptive setup more appealing.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T06:30:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T06:30:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>2007 SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING IN CHINA, VOLS 1 AND 2,740-744</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-1-4244-1008-8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15933</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2390</dc:identifier><dc:source>2nd International Conference on Communications and Networking in China,Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA,AUG 22-24, 2007</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
