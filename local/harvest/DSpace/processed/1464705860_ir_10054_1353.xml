We describe BANKS, a system which enables keyword-based search on relational databases, together with data and schema browsing. BANKS enables users to extract information in a simple manner without any knowledge of the schema or any need for writing complex queries. A user can get information by typing a few keywords, following hyperlinks, and interacting with controls on the displayed results. BANKS models tuples as nodes in a graph, connected by links induced by foreign key and other relationships. Answers to a query are modeled as rooted trees connecting tuples that match individual keywords in the query. Answers are ranked using a notion of proximity coupled with a notion of prestige of nodes based on inlinks, similar to techniques developed for Web search. We present an efficient heuristic algorithm for finding and ranking query results.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-05-12T14:22:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T08:00:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:57:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-05-12T14:22:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-28T08:00:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:57:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Data Engineering, San Jose, California, USA, 26 February-1 March 2002,431-440</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7695-1531-2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1109/ICDE.2002.994756</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1353</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1353</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
