The B4 topology offers the advantage of reduced cost and bridge losses at the expense of increased DC-side voltage and device stress. This design also provides the advantages associated with one-cycle control. This constant frequency switching technique requires neither load VAR calculation nor reference waveform generation and the control circuit is simple. Through analysis and simulations, the feasibility of the design and essential differences from a similar design reported in the literature are examined. A laboratory prototype has also been built and the experimental filter is able to compensate low power factor loads and suppress harmonic currents.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-25T09:08:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-25T09:08:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>PESC 04: 2004 IEEE 35TH ANNUAL POWER ELECTRONICS SPECIALISTS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-6, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS,2333-2339</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-8399-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0275-9306</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15669</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2272</dc:identifier><dc:source>35th Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference (PESC 04),Aachen, GERMANY,JUN 20-25, 2004</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
