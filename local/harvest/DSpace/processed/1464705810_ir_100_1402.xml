During 1990s several Air Separation Plants of large size were set up in various parts of the country. At present the total tonnage capacity of Air Separation Plants is over 15000 TPD. Prior to 1990, Cryogenics was confined to the scientific laboratories and industries for experimental investigations. However, there is a quantum jump in these activities and successful development of technology has been witnessed. This paper provides a summary of the major cryogenics activities in India.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INT INST REFRIGERATION</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-20T03:57:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-20T03:57:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>SIXTH CRYOGENICS 2000, PROCEEDINGS,(6)99-102</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0151-1637</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/14578</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/1402</dc:identifier><dc:source>6th International Cryogenics Conference of the International-Institute-of-Refrigeration,PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC,OCT 10-13, 2000</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
