These devices are based on bar linkage mechanisms and can be built in sizes ranging from a few microns to a few meters. These devices provide a convenient means of handling simple logic in mechanical systems. Some of the features available in the mechanical devices, but not available in their electronic counterparts, can lead to novel solutions. These devices provide a convenient means of handling simple logic in mechanical systems. Two input logic gates, which are the basic building blocks, are synthesized through 2-DOF closed chains. Digital circuits are then built using these simple gates to realize complex Boolean functions for a few applications.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CHINA MACHINE PRESS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T18:14:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T18:14:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>ELEVENTH WORLD CONGRESS IN MECHANISM AND MACHINE SCIENCE, VOLS 1-5, PROCEEDINGS,1300-1304</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>7-111-14073-7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/16085</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2673</dc:identifier><dc:source>11th World Congress in Mechanism and Machine Science,Tianjin, PEOPLES R CHINA,APR 01-04, 2004</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
