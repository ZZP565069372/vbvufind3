Specifically, the rans-[{1-benzyl-3-(3,3-dimethyl-2-oxobutyl)imidazol-2-ylid-ene}(2)PdBr2] (3) and cis-[{1-benzyl-3-(Ntert-butylacetamido)imidazol-2-ylid-ene}(2)PdCl2] (4) complexes effectively catalyzed the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction of aryl iodides with substituted acetylenes in air in a mixed solvent (DMF/H2O, 3:1 v/v) under amine-free conditions. Interestingly, these trans- and cis-[(NHC)(2)PdX2] (X=Cl, Br) complexes, with two N-heterocyclic carbene ligands, exhibited superior activity compared with the now popular PEPPSI (pyridine enhanced precatalyst preparation, stabilization and initiation)-themed analogues, trans-[(NHC)Pd(pyridine)X-2] (X=Cl, Br, 3a and 4a, with one N-heterocyclic carbene ligand and a "throw away" pyridine ligand in a trans disposition to each other. The higher activities of 3 and 4 compared with PEPPSI analogues 3a and 4a are attributed to more-clectron-rich metal centers, as revealed by DFT studies, in the former complexes and is in concurrence with a more electron-rich metal center being effective in facilitating the oxidative addition of aryl halide, often a rate-determining step in palladium-mediated cross-coupling reactions. Complexes 3 and 4 were prepared from the corresponding silver analogues by transmetalation with [(cod)PdCl2], whereas the corresponding PEPPSI analogues 3a and 4a were obtained directly from the imidazolium halide salts by reaction with PdCl2 in pyridine in the presence of K2CO3 as base.</dc:description><dc:publisher>WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-09-01T17:42:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-09-01T17:42:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL, 14(22), 6646-6655</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0947-6539</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chem.200800301</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12832</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12832</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
