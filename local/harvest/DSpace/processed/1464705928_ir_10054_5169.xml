The degradation pathways were elucidated by performing whole-cell O-2 uptake, enzyme activity and induction studies. Depending on the mixture of carbon source and the preculture condition, strain PPH was found to degrade 2-hydroxybenzoate either via the catechol or gentisate route and has both salicylate 1-hydroxylase and salicylate 5-hydroxylase. Strain PPD utilizes 2-hydroxybenzoate via gentisate. Both strains degrade 3- and 4-hydroxybenzoate via gentisate and protocatechuate, respectively. Enzymes were induced by respective hydroxybenzoate. Growth pattern, O-2 uptake and enzyme activity profiles on the mixture of three hydroxybenzoates as a carbon source suggest coutilization by both strains. When 3- or 4-hydroxybenzoate grown culture was used as an inoculum, strain PPH failed to utilize 2-hydroxybenzoate via catechol, indicating the modulation of the metabolic pathways, thus generating metabolic diversity.</dc:description><dc:publisher>BLACKWELL PUBLISHING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-19T04:11:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-19T04:11:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS, 268(1), 59-66</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0378-1097</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2006.00561.x</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5169</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5169</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
