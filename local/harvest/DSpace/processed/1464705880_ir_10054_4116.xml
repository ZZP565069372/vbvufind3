This study extends previous work in which the most stable forms of anionic, five-member rings with one to five nitrogens were considered. Whereas the lowest electron detachment energies sometimes are assigned by Koopmans's theorem results to pi orbital vacancies, electron propagator calculations always obtain sigma orbital vacancies for the ground states of the doublet radicals. Higher electron detachment energies that correspond to excited doublets with pi vacancies also are presented. The predicted transition energies are in good agreement with low-intensity peaks in recent anion photoelectron spectra that have been assigned to less stable, tautomeric forms of these anions.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER CHEMICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-15T01:28:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-15T01:28:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:49:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:34:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A, 111(50), 13069-13074</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1089-5639</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp075496m</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4116</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4116</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
