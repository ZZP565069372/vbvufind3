The literature on working women and dual career couples have usually focused on the psychology of women and have suggested solutions to problems to help the couple make necessary adjustment. Very few articles have focused on what the organisation can do to help women grow and rise in the organisational hierarchy. This paper will discuss the major factors that influence women's growth in the organisation, under three broad areas, namely, socialisation process, individual characteristics and organisational practices and policies. Some suggestions for strategies that could help integrate women within the workplace are also discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TATA INST SOCIAL SCIENCE P O BOX 8313</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-15T07:08:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-15T07:08:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>1991</dc:date><dc:type>Review</dc:type><dc:identifier>INDIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK,52(4)493-514</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0019-5634</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/13944</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/3137</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
