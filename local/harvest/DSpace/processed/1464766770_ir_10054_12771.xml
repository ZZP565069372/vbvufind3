It does so by providing essential signals required for swarming. It has also been demonstrated that DegU is required for swarming and that it occurs at very low levels of DegU similar to P and is inhibited at high levels of DegU similar to P. In this study, we show that maximal epr expression is observed at very low concentrations of DegU similar to P, whereas it is repressed at high DegU similar to P. A parallel effect of DegU similar to P levels on swarming motility is also observed, where very low levels of DegU similar to P support swarming and excessive DegU similar to P abolishes swarming. We further demonstrate that the defect of swarming motility in a degU(-) strain can be rescued, albeit incompletely, by increased expression of an exogenous epr gene. We also show that an additional extracellular factor(s), apart from epr, regulated by DegU, is required for robust swarming.</dc:description><dc:publisher>WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-09-01T11:47:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-09-01T11:47:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:52:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS, 295(2), 187-194</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0378-1097</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01596.x</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12771</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12771</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
