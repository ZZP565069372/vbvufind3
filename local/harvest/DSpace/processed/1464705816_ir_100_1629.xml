Multi-Application Frameworks, designed to host multiple applications on a card, also aim at increasing the interoperability between different vendors and their applications. This paper proposes a new model named XML Agent, which significantly enhances the inter-operability of the smart card applications. The XML Agent becomes an interface through which the external world can interact with the on-card applications. The XML Agent passes the commands and data to the appropriate application as per its requirements. This model will also facilitate the programmer in developing off-card applications, with minimal information about the on-card applications.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-22T17:51:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-22T17:51:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:10:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>SMART CARD RESEARCH AND ADVANCED APPLICATIONS VI,153,303-316</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1-4020-8146-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1571-5736</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/14953</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/1629</dc:identifier><dc:source>6th International Conference on Smart Card Research and Advanced Applications held at the 18th World Computer Congress,Toulouse, FRANCE,AUG 22-27, 2004</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
