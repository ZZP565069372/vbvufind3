Participants were 150 low-income urban Indian women who were surveyed using a questionnaire designed to measure the constructs used by these theories. A combined etic-emic methodology was employed in the questionnaire design. The constructs of mastery and descriptive norm were investigated as predictors of contraceptive intention and behavior. The mentioned models indicated predictive utility for the low-income sample, with the UTB faring better than the TRA or the TPB in predicting contraceptive use.</dc:description><dc:publisher>BLACKWELL PUBLISHING</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-19T04:28:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-19T04:28:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY, 37(11), 2475-2495</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0021-9029</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2007.00205.x</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5173</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5173</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
