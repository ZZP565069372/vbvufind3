In certain conditions, a quasistationary analysis can also be performed. The first two methods of analysis are difficult to apply for complex situations such as problems involving soil-structure interaction, nonclassical damping and primary-secondary structure interaction. The quasi-stationary analysis, on the other hand, provides an easier solution procedure for such cases. Here-in, the effectiveness of the quasi-stationary analysis is examined with the help of the analysis of a single degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system under a set of parametric variations. For this purpose, responses of the SDOF system to uniformly modulated non-stationary random ground excitation are obtained by the three methods and they are compared. In addition, the relative computational efforts for different methods are also investigated.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IOS PRESS</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-04T03:41:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-04T03:41:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>SHOCK AND VIBRATION, 6(5-6), 285-297</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1070-9622</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9237</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9237</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
