The study reveals that the multiple types of defects are formed in GaN layers during the Gd incorporation. However, the density of only one defect type, which results in a strong luminescence feature at 3.05 eV in the photoluminescence spectra recorded at low temperatures in GaN:Gd layers, has been found to decrease significantly upon annealing and at the same time, the saturation magnetization is also observed to reduce, suggesting that these defects are responsible for the magnetic properties observed in this system.
