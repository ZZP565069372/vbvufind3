To be able to set the correct parameter values, it is important that behavior of the steel being cast under different casting conditions is well understood. This will need the knowledge of the mechanical behavior of steels at temperatures near the solidus. This paper presents, in detail, how these properties were modeled as a function of steel grade, temperature, and stresses that arise during casting, These models have been used to develop an integrated system that is capable of simulating various process conditions that may be encountered during continuous casting. The details of how these models were developed, verified, and used to develop the integrated system are presented in this paper.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MARCEL DEKKER INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-18T07:32:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-18T07:32:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:41:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, 18(2), 287-312</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1042-6914</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1081/AMP-120018910</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9927</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9927</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
