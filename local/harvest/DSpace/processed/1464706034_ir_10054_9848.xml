There are a number of issues with Cu/low-k integration, such as Cu diffusion in the porous low-k film, moisture penetration, and damage during backend processing steps like etching and photoresist ashing. Water vapor is introduced into the low-k layer during ashing of the photo resist, which raises the k value to typically above 3. We have successfully addressed all these issues in the case of hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) (k = 2.8) with the help of a non-plasma-based hot-wire-induced chemical-vapor process (HWCVP). With the help of this process, we have also been successful in developing an ultra-thin hydrogenated amorphous silicon-carbon-based barrier layer that completely avoids copper diffusion and shows a higher resistance to electromigration.</dc:description><dc:publisher>KOREAN PHYSICAL SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-17T11:23:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:40:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-17T11:23:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:55:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:40:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY, 49(3), 1281-1286</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0374-4884</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9848</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9848</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
