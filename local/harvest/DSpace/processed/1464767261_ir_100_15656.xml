In-plane shear properties were determined with +/- 45 degree off-axis compression and tension tests using a split Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus. In-plane shear properties are presented as a function of axial and shear strain rates. The range of axial strain rates for off-axis compression tests was 819-2003 per sec, and for off-axis tension tests was 91-180 per sec, whereas the range of shear strain rates for off-axis compression tests was 1388-3442 per sec and for off-axis tension tests was 153-303 per sec. In general, it was observed that in-plane shear strength was enhanced at high strain rate loading compared to that at quasi-static loading. Also, it was observed that in-plane shear strength increased with increasing strain rate within the range of strain rates considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
