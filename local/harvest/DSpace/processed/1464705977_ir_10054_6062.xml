This paper extends the present trend prevailing in the literature on surface integrity analysis of superalloys by performing a comprehensive investigation to analyze the nature of deformation beneath the machined surface and arrive at the thickness of machining affected zone (MAZ). The residual stress analysis, microhardness measurements and degree of work hardening in the machined sub-surfaces were used as criteria to obtain the optimum machining conditions that give machined surfaces with high integrity. It is observed that the highest cutting speed, the lowest feedrate, and the moderate depth of cut coupled with the use of honed cutting edge can ensure induction of compressive residual stresses in the machined surfaces, which in turn were found to be free of smeared areas and adhered chip particles.
