The enzyme was found to be NAD(P)H-dependent external flavin monooxygenase. Though the kinetic parameters of 1-NH from strain C5 appear to be similar to 1-NH enzyme from strains C4 and C6, however, they differ in their N-terminal sequences, mole content of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), reconstitution of apoenzyme, and K (i). 1-NH showed narrow substrate specificity with comparable hydroxylation efficiency on 1-naphthol and 5-amino 1-naphthol (similar to 30 %) followed by 4-chloro 1-naphthol (similar to 9 %). Salicylate was found to be the nonsubstrate effector. The flavin fluorescence of 1-NH was found to increase in the presence of 1-naphthol (K (d) = 11.3 mu M) and salicylate (K (d) = 1027 mu M). The circular dichroism (CD) spectra showed significant perturbations in the presence of NAD(P)H, whereas no changes were observed in the presence of 1-naphthol. Naphthalene, 1-chloronaphthalene, 2-napthol, and 2-naphthoic acid were found to be the mixed inhibitors. Chemical modification studies showed the probable involvement of His, Cys, and Tyr in the binding of 1-naphthol, whereas Trp was found to be involved in the binding of NAD(P)H.</dc:description><dc:publisher>HUMANA PRESS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-12-28T14:28:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-12-28T14:28:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY, 172(8)3964-3977</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0273-2289</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1559-0291</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-014-0815-4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/16754</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
