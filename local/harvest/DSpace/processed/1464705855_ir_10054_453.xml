One approach to reduce traffic during the routing process is to divide the network into clusters. Until now, there have been several approaches to cluster-based routing. We propose a voting based clustering strategy to form a network with spatial and temporal stability. The selection of cluster head and cluster size is done in a very efficient manner. We present algorithms for creation of clusters and their maintenance in the presence of various network events. Our strategy outperforms existing and conventional clustering approaches in terms of number of hops required, at a little overhead cost during topology updates. The strategy performs very well when the density of nodes is high.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-12-22T05:47:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-27T19:56:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:56:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-12-22T05:47:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-11-27T19:56:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:56:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Personal Wireless Communications, New Delhi, India, 23-25 January 2005, 67-71</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0-7803-8964-6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1109/ICPWC.2005.1431303</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/453</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/453</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
