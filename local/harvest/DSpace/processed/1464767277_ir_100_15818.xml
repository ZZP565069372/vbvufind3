Boundary value problem (BVP) of an axisymmetric cylinder is considered here as a two-dimensional plane strain problem in the (r, z) plane, which is based on the exact theory of elasticity. After assuming diaphragm-supported end conditions in the longitudinal (z) direction, the resulting mathematical model is cast in the form of first-order simultaneous ordinary differential equations which are integrated through an effective numerical integration technique by first transforming the BVP into a set of initial value problems. New results of finite length cylinders are generated and presented for future reference.</dc:description><dc:publisher>INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T14:45:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T14:45:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>CURRENT SCIENCE, 102(1)50-60</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15818</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
