The main advantage of this technique, however, is that it facilitates imaging of relatively thick (1-10 mu m) samples at high resolution in the wet condition without the necessity of external contrast-enhancing agents. Although this technique has been proved to be highly useful for biological imaging, it is still not widely used because of the technological difficulties. This paper deals with the technological issues of soft X-ray microscopy vis-h-vis the recent developments in these areas which will widen the application potential of this technique.</dc:description><dc:publisher>CURRENT SCIENCE ASSN</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-13T23:18:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-13T23:18:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:16:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Review</dc:type><dc:identifier>CURRENT SCIENCE,73(5)429-435</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0011-3891</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/13876</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/3047</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
