After preliminary treatment, these materials were subjected to steam or carbon dioxide activation in the range 500-900-degrees-C. In other experiments the raw materials were partly air-oxidized at approximately 200-degrees-C, mixed with binder and extruded to cylindrical pellets, which were subjected to coke deposition by cracking of methane in the range 750-780-degrees-C for 5-14 min. All the products were characterized by analysis of kinetic and equilibrium adsorption data. The molecular sieve performance was judged by the O2/N2 uptake ratio. The best carbon molecular sieves, obtained by methane cracking at 780-degrees-C at a flow of 100 ml min-1 had an uptake ratio of 2.667.</dc:description><dc:publisher>BUTTERWORTH-HEINEMANN LTD</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-19T09:16:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-19T09:16:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:51:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:37:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>1993</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>FUEL, 72(4), 551-555</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0016-2361</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-2361(93)90115-I</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/5242</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/5242</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
