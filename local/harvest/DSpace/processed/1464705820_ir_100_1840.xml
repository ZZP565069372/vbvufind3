Attempt is made to correlate the properties of the films with the gas phase chemistry during deposition. Interestingly, unlike in PECVD, partial pressure of H-2 is higher than any other species during deposition of a-Si:H as well as muc-Si:H. Effect of hydrogen dilution on film properties and on concentration of various chemical species in the gas phase is studied. For low hydrogen dilution [H-2]/[SiH4] from 0 to 1 (where [SiH4] is 10 seem), all films deposited are amorphous with photoconductivity gain of similar to 10(6). During deposition of these amorphous films SiH2 was dominant in gas phase next to [H-2]. Interestingly [Si]/[SiH2] ratio increases from 0.4 to 0.5 as dilution increased from 0 to 1, and further to more than 1 for higher hydrogen dilution leading to [Si] dominance. At hydrogen dilution ratio 20, consequently films deposited were microcrystalline.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-23T09:42:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-23T09:42:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:11:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>AMORPHOUS AND HETEROGENEOUS SILICON-BASED FILMS-2002,715,171-178</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1-55899-651-6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0272-9172</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15092</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/1840</dc:identifier><dc:source>Symposium on Amorphous and Heterogeneous Silicon-Based Films held at the 2002 MRS Spring Meeting,SAN FRANCISCO, CA,APR 02-05, 2002</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
