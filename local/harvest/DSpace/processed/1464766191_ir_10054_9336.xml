Various reaction mechanisms have been proposed for the NO-CO reaction on Pt(100), which shows bifurcations, kinetic oscillations and multiple steady states under ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions due to complex surface dynamics. Some experiments on supported Pt group catalysts reported in literature show oscillations and bistability under atmospheric conditions as well. Industrially relevant conditions require the modelling and detailed analysis of the system at atmospheric pressure. We have proposed a reaction mechanism for the NO-CO system on Pt group catalysts and coupled it with an isothermal PSR model to obtain solutions at atmospheric conditions with the continuation software CONTENT 1.5, at different operating conditions. Simulation results suggest that Pt(111) shows bifurcations at certain operating conditions while Ir(111) shows stable solutions at all the operating conditions studied here.</dc:description><dc:publisher>JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-04T10:52:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-04T10:52:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:54:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:42:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, 85(3), 333-340</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0008-4034</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/9336</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/9336</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
