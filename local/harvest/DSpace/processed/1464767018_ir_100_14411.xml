Both the models have been applied to the case study of Upper Krishna River Basin to evaluate their performances. Important statistical parameters, namely, mean, standard deviation, correlation coefficient of the historical and generated streamflow are compared for the evaluation. Hurst ratio has been used to evaluate the strength of persistence of the generated streamflow. This study shows that the streamflow predicted with simple ANN model are more satisfactory than the HEC-4 model in case of multisite streamflow generation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEI</dc:publisher><dc:date>2012-09-12T11:07:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012-09-12T11:07:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Journal of Institution of Engineers, 87(CV) 9-14</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0368-2498</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14411</dc:identifier><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
