They showed remarkably different stress strain behavior and corresponding developments in deformed microstructures. The (1 1 0) [0 0 1] oriented CRGO steel specimens retained their orientation stability until epsilon (true strain) = 0.07. On the other hand, (1 1 0) [1 (1) over bar 1] oriented specimens underwent significant reorientation and displayed formation of strain localizations by epsilon = 0.03. Discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations were carried out - three-dimensional (3-D) for "limited" (similar to 10(-4)) plastic strain and two-dimensional (2-D) for the experimentally imposed strain - to investigate the orientation effects on the tensile response of the CRGO steel specimens. 2-D DDD simulations were able to provide qualitative and quantitative estimates of the post-yield tensile behavior of (1 1 0) [0 0 1] and (1 1 0) [1 (1) over bar 1] samples. Direct comparison between experimental and simulation results confirmed the orientation effect on the overall macroscopic response of the specimens. It was observed that the response of (1 1 0) [1 (1) over bar 1] specimens showed features of reorientation and textural softening and these were captured by the Taylor type deformation simulations.
