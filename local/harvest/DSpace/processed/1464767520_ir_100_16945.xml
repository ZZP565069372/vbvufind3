The L exhibits selective chromogenic as well as fluorescent property towards Hg2+ in a ratiometric manner by showing similar to 30 fold enhanced fluorescence emission intensity. The fluorescence enhancement continues to be there even in the presence of thirteen other competitive metal ions studied. The sensing of Hg2+ is well demonstrated using various techniques, such as, fluorescence, absorption, visual color under UV light and ESI MS. A minimum detection limit of 18 +/- 2 ppb was shown by L for Hg2+ in ethanol. All the experimental studies carried out supported the formation of 2:1 complex between L and Hg2+. The structure of the 2:1 complex was modeled at ab initio using HF and found a structure where Hg2+ is sandwiched between the two pyrenyl moieties. The reversibility and reusability of L has been demonstrated using fluoride ion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
