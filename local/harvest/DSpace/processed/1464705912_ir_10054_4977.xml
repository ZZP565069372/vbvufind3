Diamond-coated IR transmitting materials are used on smart weapons and aircraft that use substrate materials such as silicon and germanium. In this investigation, diamond sheets were deposited using chemical vapor deposition. The as-grown diamond sheets were characterized for hydrogen content using detailed IR analysis. The deconvolution of the spectra in a three-phonon region (2700-3150 cm(-1)) showed a number of vibration modes corresponding to the sp(m)CH(n) phase of carbon. The spectra representing (100) and (111) textured diamond sheets, grown under different conditions, were compared. The (100) textured sheets contained two dominant peaks centered at 2860 and 2930 cm(-1), which correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric stretch bands of the CH2 group. However, the sheet with (111) texture displayed multiple CH, CH2, and CH3 peaks on the spectrum. Using a standard sample called polymethyl methacrylate with known concentration, the hydrogen content associated with various modes was evaluated in the diamond sheets. IR active hydrogen in the chemical vapor deposited diamond sheets was also calculated by evaluating the area of the IR band. A discrepancy of one order of magnitude was found in the calculated and measured value. Using these measurements we suggest that the oscillator strength of the different IR modes varies depending upon the structure and H content of CVD diamond sheets.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ASM INTERNATIONAL</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-18T16:15:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-18T16:15:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE, 14(5), 666-670</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1059-9495</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1361/105994905X64611</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4977</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4977</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
