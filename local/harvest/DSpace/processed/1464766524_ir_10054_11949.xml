A set of iron ore and phyllite samples were also used for comparison with the soil chemical data. Discriminant analysis on normalised major and trace element data of soil, ore and phyllite samples suggested a clear discrimination between chemical data of soil, ore and phyllite samples. From the R-mode factor analysis four common factors were retained from the chemical data of soil. First and second rotated factors were explained as natural processes such as weathering, secondary alteration of clay minerals and lateritisation process. The third and fourth rotated factor were interpreted as anthropogenic sources such as fertilizers, atmospheric fallout and vehicular exhausts.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SELPER LTD, PUBLICATIONS DIV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-29T04:00:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-29T04:00:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:58:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:48:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>1994</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY, 15(9), 853-862</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0959-3330</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/11949</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/11949</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
