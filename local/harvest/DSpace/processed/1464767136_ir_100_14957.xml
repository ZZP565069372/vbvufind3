All edges of a plate are under simply supported (diaphragm) end conditions and general stress boundary conditions can be applied on both top and bottom surface of a plate during solution. A mixed semi-analytical model consists in defining a two-point boundary value problem governed by a set of first-order ordinary differential equations in the plate thickness direction. Analytical solutions based on shear-normal deformation theories are also established to show the accuracy, simplicity and effectiveness of mixed semi-analytical model. The FG material is assumed to be exponential in the thickness direction and Poisson's ratio is assumed to be constant.</dc:description><dc:publisher>SPRINGER HEIDELBERG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-15T13:04:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-15T13:04:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICS AND MATERIALS IN DESIGN, 8(1)51-69</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10999-011-9175-1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/14957</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
