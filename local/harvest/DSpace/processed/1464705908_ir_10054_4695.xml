The samples for the investigation were extracted from bead-on-plate weldments made by depositing 2.25Cr-1Mo weld metal on 9Cr-1Mo base plate and vice versa. Subsequent application of PWHT resulted in the formation of a soft zone in the low Cr ferritic steel weld or base plate. A carbide-rich hard zone, adjoining the soft zone, was also detected in the high Cr side of the weldment. Unmixed zones in the weld metal provided additional soft and hard zones in the weld metals. The migration of carbon from low-Cr steel to high-Cr steel, driven by the carbon activity gradient, has been shown to be responsible for the formation of soft and hard zones. A carbon activity diagram for 2.25Cr-1Mo/9Cr-1Mo weldments has been proposed to aid in the selection of welding consumables for reducing or preventing the soft zone formation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>AMER WELDING SOC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-07-17T10:06:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-17T10:06:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:50:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:36:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>WELDING JOURNAL, 76(3), S135-S142</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0043-2296</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/4695</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/4695</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
