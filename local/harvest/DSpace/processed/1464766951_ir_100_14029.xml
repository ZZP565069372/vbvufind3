Each layer built through overlapping beads is face milled to remove the scales and scallops and ensure Z-accuracy. The formations of single beads and overlapping multiple beads are modeled in this paper. While the individual bead's geometry is influenced by the size of the filler wire and the speeds of the wire and torch, the step over increment between the consecutive beads additionally comes into the picture for the multiple bead deposition. These models were validated experimentally. They are useful not only to predict the bead's shape but also to optimize the three process parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
