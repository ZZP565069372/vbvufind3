However, existing RP processes suffer from staircase defects since they are all based on 2.5-axis kinematics. To minimize the error due to staircase defects parts are normally built from very thin layers typically with thickness values of 0.010 to 0.300 mm. Therefore, hundreds of layers are required to produce a typical object making RP a slow and costly process. To overcome these limitations, a new RP process called Segmented Object Manufacturing (SOM) is proposed in this paper. SOM makes use of three-axis kinematics in conjunction with a novel slicing method. Slicing in SOM is based on certain visibility-based considerations and is independent of the part accuracy. Since only a few thick layers are used in the SOM technique, a part can be produced faster and cheaper with an accuracy comparable to that of CNC machining.</dc:description><dc:publisher>TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-08-30T18:28:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:50:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-30T18:28:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T12:59:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:50:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IIE TRANSACTIONS, 37(4), 291-302</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>0740-817X</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07408170590516999</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/12422</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/12422</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
