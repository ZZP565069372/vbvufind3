With a view to locate new porphyrins for use in PDT, we evaluated the ability of a novel water-soluble porphyrin, meso-tetrakis[4-(carboxymethyleneoxy)phenyl]porphyrin (T4CPP) to induce photodamage in membranes, using rat hepatic microsomes as a model system. Hepatic microsomes treated with T4CPP and exposed to visible light showed significant lipid peroxidation, as assessed by the formation of conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. The peroxidation induced was both time- and concentration-dependent. T4CPP plus light also resulted in the destruction of the microsomal enzymes adenosine triphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase. Analysis of the products of peroxidation and selective inhibition by specific inhibitors showed that the oxidative damage induced was mainly due to singlet oxygen and partly due to hydroxyl radical. The porphyrin T4CPP was efficiently labeled with Tc-99m. When this Tc-99m-labeled porphyrin was injected into a mammary-tumor-bearing rat, it accumulated in the tumor. Our studies suggest that T4CPP, due to its potential to localize in tumors and to induce membrane damage as exemplified by alteration in rat liver microsomes, may have possible applications in this new modality of cancer treatment.
