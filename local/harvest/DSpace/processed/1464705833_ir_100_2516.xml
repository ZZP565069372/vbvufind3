In keeping with this view many countries around the world have tried to solve the transport sustainability problem by opting for integrated land use and transport strategies. Various land use measures have been used in conjunction with transport policies to achieve integrated approaches in these cities. This paper summarizes the experiences of various cities of Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Asia, in this regard. The objective is to draw lessons from these experiences so that the fast growing cities of the developing world can orient their strategies in the right direction at right time. It is concluded that only a coordinated/integrated land use transport planning approach will lead to a sustainable development.</dc:description><dc:publisher>HONG KONG UNIVERSITY SCIENCE &amp;TECHNOLOGY</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-10-26T09:07:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-26T09:07:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-15T09:12:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Proceedings Paper</dc:type><dc:identifier>TRANSPORTATION STUDIES: SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF HONG KONG SOCIETY FOR TRANSPORTATION STUDIES,89-98</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>978-988-98847-0-3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/15964</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/100/2516</dc:identifier><dc:source>11th International Conference of the Hong-Kong-Society-for-Transportation-Studies,Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA,DEC 09-11, 2006</dc:source><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
