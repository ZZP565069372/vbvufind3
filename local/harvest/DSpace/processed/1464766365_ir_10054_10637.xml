Sodium acetate and sodium nitrate were used as electron donor (substrate) and electron acceptor, respectively. Nitrate nitrogen loading was increased from 0.098 to 0.6 kg/m(3) d in order to keep COD/NO3--N ratio as 20.8, 14.3, 9.8, 5.0, 4.0 and 3.33. Throughout the study, input nitrophenolic concentration and hydraulic retention time (HRT) were kept constant as 30 mg/l and 24 h, respectively. 2-Aminophenol (2-AP), 4-aminophenol (4-AP) and 2-amino,4,-nitrophenol (2-A,4-NP) were found as the major intermediate metabolite of 2-NP, 4-NP and 2,4-DNP, respectively. Removal of all the three nitrophenols increased with lowering of COD/NO3--N ratio. However, nitrophenols removal got adversely affected when COD/NO3--N ratio was reduced below 5. Maximum removal achieved were 91.63%, 90.17% and 86.10% for 2-NP, 4-NP and 2,4-DNP, respectively at a COD/NO3--N ratio of 5. Simultaneous denitrification and methanogenesis was observed in all the reactors throughout the study.
