Four sets of beams, three with different amounts of CFRPC reinforcement by changing the width of CFRPC laminate, and one without CFRPC were tested in four-point bending over a span of 900 mm. The tests were carried out under displacement control. At least one beam in a set was extensively instrumented to monitor strains and deflections over the entire range of loading till the failure of the beam. The increase in strength and stiffness provided by the bonded laminate was assessed by varying the width of laminate. The results indicate that the flexural strength of beams was significantly increased as the width of laminate increased. Theoretical analysis using a computer program based on strain compatibility is presented to predict the ultimate strength and momentâ€“deflection behavior of the beams. The comparison of the experimental results with theoretical values is also presented, along with an investigation of the beam failure modes.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier</dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-05-08T02:36:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-08T06:57:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:01:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-05-08T02:36:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-08T06:57:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-26T13:01:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-12-27T05:47:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>Composites Part B: Engineering 31(6-7), 461-470</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1359-8368</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1016/S1359-8368(00)00022-6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10054/1303</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10054/1303</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
