We extend our work in [1], in which we defined and analyzed the causes of the stagnation of broadband penetration in India, and propose a comprehensive solution. Specifically, we understand the problem from a business perspective, and then propose a novel techno-economic model that is shown to lead to enhanced broadband penetration. This model is based on a concept that we term global content balancing - showcasing the relationship between content and the proliferation of broadband. We show the working of this model and postulate reasons for its acceptability and success. A simulations study evaluates our solution and compares it to usage-based approaches, showing a return on investment improvement.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC</dc:publisher><dc:date>2014-10-16T13:17:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2014-10-16T13:17:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE, 50(5)74-81</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/100/15644</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>
