A range of slurry compositions with soapnut amounts ranging from 2 to 20 wt% in water, alumina loading of 35-55 vol% were studied. Though all slurry compositions foamed when subjected to mechanical agitation the formation of green ceramic foams free of macroscopic defects was found to be strongly dependent on conditions during drying of foamed slurries. Addition of guar gum to the slurries was shown to enhance foam stability and thus produce defect-free foams from compositions that otherwise either collapsed or resulted in other macroscopic defects during drying. Drying conditions also had a strong effect on microstructural parameters such as cell size and cell connectivity. Soapnut-based foams appear to have a greater connectivity between cells than foams produced by other comparable processes.
